- en: The fact that the memory is partitioned into 64B [cache lines](../cache-lines)
    makes it difficult to operate on data words that cross a cache line boundary.
    When you need to retrieve some primitive type, such as a 32-bit integer, you really
    want to have it located on a single cache line — both because retrieving two cache
    lines requires more memory bandwidth and stitching the results in hardware requires
    precious transistor space.

- en: By default, when you allocate an array of some primitive type, you are guaranteed
    that the addresses of all elements are a multiple of their size, which ensures
    that they only span a single cache line. For example, you are guaranteed the address
    of the first and every other element of an `int` array is a multiple of 4 bytes
    (`sizeof int`).

    rounded up to the nearest multiple of 64 bytes. This has to be done so that, e.g.,
    when allocating an array of `Data`, not just the first element is properly aligned.

    elements, which is the case for structures. Instead of playing Tetris trying to
    rearrange the members of a `struct` so that each of them is within a single cache
    line — which isn’t always possible as the structure itself doesn’t have to be
    placed on the start of a cache line — most C/C++ compilers also rely on the mechanism
    of memory alignment.
