The company collects information about product scans made on mobile
phones, and Debbie’s analytic tools classified these by product, by
region, by time, and so on.  As a good programmer, Debbie first wrote
synthetic test cases, then developed her programs and tested them.
She then obtained some actual test data from the company, broke them
down into small chunks, computed the expected answers by hand, and
tested her programs again against these real (but small) data sets.
At the end of this she was ready to declare the programs ready.</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">At this point, however, she had only tested them for functional
correctness.  There was still a question of how quickly her analytical
tools would produce answers.  This presented two problems:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>The company was rightly reluctant to share the entire dataset
with outsiders, and in turn we didn’t want to be responsible for
carefully guarding all their data.</p></li><li><p>Even if we did get a sample of their data, as more users used
their product, the amount of data they had was sure to grow.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">We therefore got only a sampling of their full data, and from this had
to make some prediction on how long it would take to run the analytics
on subsets (e.g., those corresponding to just one region) or all of
their data set, both today and as it grew over time.</div><p>Debbie was given 100,000 data points.  She broke them down into input
sets of 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 data points, ran her tools
on each input size, and plotted the result.</p><p>From this graph we have a good bet at guessing how long the tool would
take on a dataset of 50,000.  It’s much harder, however, to be sure
how long it would take on datasets of size 1.5 million or 3 million or
10 million.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">These processes are respectively called
<span style="font-style: italic">interpolation</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">extrapolation</span>.</span></span></span>  We’ve already explained
why we couldn’t get more data from the company.  So what could we do?</p><p>As another problem, suppose we have multiple implementations
available. When we plot their running time, say the graphs look like
this, with red, green, and blue each representing different
implementations. On small inputs, suppose the running times look like
this:</p><p><img src="../Images/1fe6a875e4a9f3d3a6f962c860dda585.png" alt="image" width="400.0" height="400.0" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/pict.png"/></p><p>This doesn’t seem to help us distinguish between the
implementations. Now suppose we run the algorithms on larger inputs,
and we get the following graphs:</p><p><img src="../Images/e4ff72c49a10103cea5fe1690ae0b404.png" alt="image" width="400.0" height="400.0" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/pict_2.png"/></p><p>Now we seem to have a clear winner (red), though it’s not clear there
is much to give between the other two (blue and green). But if we
calculate on even larger inputs, we start to see dramatic differences:</p><p><img src="../Images/d9aeccc8e556d7c4435cdf97c958a74d.png" alt="image" width="400.0" height="400.0" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/pict_3.png"/></p><p>In fact, the functions that resulted in these lines were the same in
all three figures. What these pictures tell us is that it is
dangerous to extrapolate too much from the performance on small
inputs. If we could obtain closed-form descriptions of the performance
of computations, it would be nice if we could compare them
better. That is what we will do in the next section.</p><blockquote class="RespCS"><p class="RespCSHeader">Responsible Computing: Choose Analysis Artifacts Wisely</p><blockquote class="RespCSBody"><p>As more and more decisions are guided by statistical analyses of data
(performed by humans), it’s critical to recognize that data can be a
poor proxy for the actual phenomenon that we seek to understand. Here,
Debbie had data about program behavior, which led to
mis-interpretations regarding which program is best. But Debbie also
had the programs themselves, from which the data were
generated. Analyzing the programs, rather than the data, is a more
direct approach to assessing the performance of a program.</p><p>While the rest of this chapter is about analyzing programs as written
in code, this point carries over to non-programs as well. You might
want to understand the effectiveness of a process for triaging
patients at a hospital, for example. In that case, you have both the
policy documents (rules which may or may not have been turned into a
software program to support managing patients) and data on the
effectiveness of using that process. Responsible computing tells us to
analyze both the process and its behavioral data, against knowledge
about best practices in patient care, to evaluate the effectiveness of
systems.</p></blockquote></blockquote></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 14.2"><h3 class="heading">14.2<span class="stt"> </span><a name="(part._.The_.Analytical_.Idea)"/>The Analytical Idea<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._.The_.Analytical_.Idea)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h3><p>With many physical processes, the best we can do is obtain as many
data points as possible, extrapolate, and apply statistics to reason
about the most likely outcome.  Sometimes we can do that in computer
science, too, but fortunately we computer scientists have an enormous
advantage over most other sciences: instead of measuring a black-box
process, we have full access to its internals, namely the source code.
This enables us to apply <span style="font-style: italic">analytical</span> methods.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">“Analytical”
means applying algebraic and other mathematical methods to make
predictive statements about a process without running it.</span></span></span>  The answer
we compute this way is complementary to what we obtain from the above
experimental analysis, and in practice we will usually want to use a
combination of the two to arrive a strong understanding of the
program’s behavior.</p><p>The analytical idea is startlingly simple.  We look at the source of
the program and list the operations it performs.  For each operation,
we look up what it costs.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">We are going to focus on one kind of
cost, namely running time.  There are many other other kinds of costs
one can compute. We might naturally be interested in space (memory)
consumed, which tells us how big a machine we need to buy. We might
also care about power, this tells us the cost of our energy bills, or
of bandwidth, which tells us what kind of Internet connection we will
need.  In general, then, we’re interested in <span class="emph">resource
consumption</span>.  In short, don’t make the mistake of equating
“performance” with “speed”: the costs that matter depend on the
context in which the application runs.</span></span></span>  We add up these costs for all
the operations.  This gives us a total cost for the program.</p><p>Naturally, for most programs the answer will not be a constant number.
Rather, it will depend on factors such as the size of the input.
Therefore, our answer is likely to be an expression in terms of
parameters (such as the input’s size).  In other words, our answer will
be a function.</p><p>There are many functions that can describe the running-time of a
function.  Often we want an <span style="font-style: italic">upper bound</span> on the running time:
i.e., the actual number of operations will always be no more than what
the function predicts.  This tells us the maximum resource we will
need to allocate.  Another function may present a <span style="font-style: italic">lower bound</span>,
which tells us the least resource we need.  Sometimes we want an
<span style="font-style: italic">average-case analysis</span>.  And so on.  In this text we will focus
on upper-bounds, but keep in mind that all these other analyses are
also extremely valuable.</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>It is incorrect to speak of “the” upper-bound function, because
there isn’t just one.  Given one upper-bound function, can you
construct another one?</p></blockquote></blockquote></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 14.3"><h3 class="heading">14.3<span class="stt"> </span><a name="(part._cost-model)"/>A Cost Model for Pyret Running Time<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._cost-model)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h3><p>We begin by presenting a cost model for the running time of Pyret
programs.  We are interested in the cost of running a program, which
is tantamount to studying the expressions of a program.  Simply making
a definition does not cost anything; the cost is incurred only when we
use a definition.</p><p>We will use a very simple (but sufficiently accurate) cost model:
every operation costs one unit of time in addition to the time needed
to evaluate its sub-expressions.  Thus it takes one unit of time to
look up a variable or to allocate a constant.  Applying primitive
functions also costs one unit of time.  Everything else is a compound
expression with sub-expressions.  The cost of a compound expression is
one plus that of each of its sub-expressions.  For instance, the
running time cost of the expression <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e1 + e2</code></span> (for some
sub-expressions <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e1</code></span> and <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e2</code></span>) is the running time for
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e1</code></span> + the running time for <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e2</code></span> + 1.  Thus the expression
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">17 + 29</code></span> has a cost of 3 (one for each sub-expression and one
for the addition); the expression <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">1 + (7 * (2 / 9))</code></span> costs 7.</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">As you can see, there are two big approximations here:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>First, we are using an abstract rather than concrete notion of
time.  This is unhelpful in terms of estimating the so-called “wall
clock” running time of a program, but then again, that number depends
on numerous factors—<wbr/>not just what kind of processor and how much
memory you have, but even what other tasks are running on your
computer at the same time.  In contrast, abstract time units are more
portable.</p></li><li><p>Second, not every operation takes the same number of machine
cycles, whereas we have charged all of them the same number of
abstract time units.  As long as the actual number of cycles each one
takes is bounded by a constant factor of the number taken by another,
this will not pose any mathematical problems for reasons we will soon
understand [<a href="#%28part._big-oh-def%29" data-pltdoc="x">Comparing Functions</a>].</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">Of course, it is instructive—<wbr/>after carefully settting up the
experimental conditions—<wbr/>to make an analytical prediction of a program’s
behavior and then verify it against what the implementation actually
does.  If the analytical prediction is accurate, we can reconstruct
the constant factors hidden in our calculations and thus obtain very
precise wall-clock time bounds for the program.</div><p>There is one especially tricky kind of expression: <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">if</code></span> (and its fancier
cousins, like <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">cases</code></span> and <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">ask</code></span>). How do we think about the cost of
an <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">if</code></span>? It always evaluates the condition. After that, it evaluates only
<span class="emph">one</span> of its branches. But we are interested in the <span style="font-style: italic">worst case</span> time,
i.e., what is the longest it could take? For a conditional, it’s the cost of
the condition added to the cost of the <span class="emph">maximum</span> of the two
branches.</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 14.4"><h3 class="heading">14.4<span class="stt"> </span><a name="(part._size-of-input)"/>The Size of the Input<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._size-of-input)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h3><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">We
gloss over the size of a number, treating it as constant.  Observe that
the <span class="emph">value</span> of a number is exponentially larger than its
<span class="emph">size</span>: \(n\) digits in base \(b\) can represent \(b^n\) numbers.
Though irrelevant here,
when numbers are central—<wbr/>e.g., when testing
primality—<wbr/>the difference becomes critical! We will return to
this briefly later [<a href="avoid-recomp.html#%28part._numbers-not-constant%29" data-pltdoc="x">The Complexity of Numbers</a>].</span></span></span></p><p>It can be subtle to define the size of the argument.  Suppose a
function consumes a list of numbers; it would be natural to define the
size of its argument to be the length of the list, i.e., the number of
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">link</code></span>s in the list.  We could also define it to be twice as
large, to account for both the <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">link</code></span>s and the individual
numbers (but as we’ll see [<a href="#%28part._big-oh-def%29" data-pltdoc="x">Comparing Functions</a>], constants usually don’t matter).
But suppose a function consumes a list of music albums, and each music
album is itself a list of songs, each of which has information about
singers and so on.  Then how we measure the size depends on what part
of the input the function being analyzed actually examines.  If, say,
it only returns the length of the list of albums, then it is
indifferent to what each list element contains [<a href="processing-lists.html#%28part._polymorphic-data%29" data-pltdoc="x">Monomorphic Lists and Polymorphic Types</a>],
and only the length of the list of albums matters.  If, however, the
function returns a list of all the singers on every album, then it
traverses all the way down to individual songs, and we have to account
for all these data.  In short, we care about the size of <span class="emph">the
data potentially accessed by the function</span>.</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 14.5"><h3 class="heading">14.5<span class="stt"> </span><a name="(part._.The_.Tabular_.Method_for_.Singly-.Structurally-.Recursive_.Functions)"/>The Tabular Method for Singly-Structurally-Recursive Functions<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._.The_.Tabular_.Method_for_.Singly-.Structurally-.Recursive_.Functions)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h3><p>Given sizes for the arguments, we simply examine the body of the
function and add up the costs of the individual operations.  Most

First, let’s consider the <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">len</code></span> function, noting before we
proceed that it does meet the criterion of having a single recursive
call where the argument is structural:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><p/><div class="sourceCodeWrapper"><span data-label="Pyret" class="sourceLangLabel"/><div class="sourceCode"><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun len(l):

    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; 1 + len(r)
  end
end</code></pre></div></div></div><div class="SIntrapara">Let’s compute the cost of running <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">len</code></span> on a list of length
\(k\) (where we are only counting the number of <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">link</code></span>s in the
list, and ignoring the content of each first element (<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">f</code></span>), since
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">len</code></span> ignores them too).</div><p>Because the entire body of <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">len</code></span> is given by a conditional, we
can proceed directly to building the table.</p><p>Let’s consider the first row.  The question costs three units (one
each to evaluate the implicit <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">empty</code></span>-ness predicate, <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">l</code></span>,
and to apply the former to the latter).
This is evaluated once per element in the list and once
more when the list is empty, i.e., \(k+1\) times.  The total cost of
the question is thus \(3(k+1)\).  The answer takes one unit of time to
compute, and is evaluated only once (when the list is empty).  Thus it
takes a total of one unit, for a total of \(3k+4\) units.</p><p>Now for the second row.  The question again costs three units, and is
evaluated \(k\) times.  The answer involves two units to evaluate
the rest of the list <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">l.rest</code></span>, which is implicitly hidden by the
naming of <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">r</code></span>, two more to evaluate and apply <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">1 +</code></span>, one
more to evaluate <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">len</code></span>...and <span class="emph">no more</span>, because we are
ignoring the time spent in the recursive call itself.
In short, it takes five units of time (in addition to the recursion
we’ve chosen to ignore).</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">In <a name="(elem._length-cost-table)"/>tabular form:

<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">f</code></span> other than the recursive call, and then add the cost of the
recursive call in terms of a reference to \(T\).  Thus, if we were
doing this for <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">len</code></span> above, we would define \(T(k)\)—<wbr/>the time
needed on an input of length \(k\)—<wbr/>in two parts: the value of
\(T(0)\) (when the list is empty) and the value for non-zero values of
\(k\).  We know that \(T(0) = 4\) (the cost of the first conditional
and its corresponding answer).  If the list is non-empty, the cost is
\(T(k) = 3 + 3 + 5 + T(k-1)\) (respectively from the first question,
the second question, the remaining operations in the second answer,
and the recursive call on a list one element smaller).  This gives the

We’ve written down a
function of great precision: 11!  4!  Is this justified?</p><p>At a fine-grained level already, no, it’s not.  We’ve lumped many
operations, with different actual running times, into a cost of one.
So perhaps we should not worry too much about the differences between,
say, \([k \rightarrow 11k + 4]\) and \([k \rightarrow 4k + 10]\).  If
we were given two implementations with these running times, respectively, it’s
likely that we would pick other characteristics to choose between
them.</p><p>What this boils down to is being able to compare two
functions (representing the performance of implementations) for
whether one is somehow quantitatively better in some meaningful
sense than the other: i.e., is the quantitative difference so great
that it might lead to a qualitative one.  The
example above suggests that small differences in constants probably
do not matter.</p><p>That is, we want a way to compare two functions, \(f_1\) and
\(f_2\). What does it mean for \(f_1\) to be “less” than \(f_2\),
without worrying about constants? We obtain this definition:</p><p type="math/tex" style="white-space: pre;" class="stt">\begin{equation*}\exists c . \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, f_1(n) \leq c \cdot f_2(n) \Rightarrow f_1 \leq f_2\end{equation*}</p><p>This says that for all natural numbers (\(N\)), the value of \(f_1\)
will always be less than the value of \(f_2\). However, to accommodate
our intution that multiplicative constants don’t matter, the
definition allows the value of \(f_2\) at all points to be multiplied
by some constant \(c\) to achieve the inequality. Observe, however,
that \(c\) is <span class="emph">independent</span> of \(n\): it is chosen once and must
then work for the infinite number of values. In practice, this means
that the presence of \(c\) lets us bypass some number of early values
where \(f_1\) might have a greater value than \(f_2\), so long as,
after a point, \(f_2\) dominates \(f_1\).</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">This definition has more flexibility than we might initially think.

the order, it would mean that for every point along the number line,
there must exist a constant—<wbr/>and there pretty much always does!  The swapped
definition would therefore be useless.  What is important is that we
can identify the constant <span class="emph">no matter how large the parameter

Thus if \(g \leq f\),
we can write \(g \in O(f)\), which we can read as “\(f\) is an

Obviously, the “bigger” function is likely to be a less useful bound
than a “tighter” one.  That said, it is conventional to write a
“minimal” bound for functions, which means avoiding unnecessary
constants, sum terms, and so on. The justification for this is given
below [<a href="#%28part._big-oh-closure%29" data-pltdoc="x">Combining Big-Oh Without Woe</a>].</div><p/><div class="SIntrapara">Pay especially close attention to our

functions—<wbr/>\(f\)—<wbr/>rather than their values at particular

The company collects information about product scans made on mobile
phones, and Debbie’s analytic tools classified these by product, by
region, by time, and so on.  As a good programmer, Debbie first wrote
synthetic test cases, then developed her programs and tested them.
She then obtained some actual test data from the company, broke them
down into small chunks, computed the expected answers by hand, and
tested her programs again against these real (but small) data sets.
At the end of this she was ready to declare the programs ready.</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">At this point, however, she had only tested them for functional
correctness.  There was still a question of how quickly her analytical
tools would produce answers.  This presented two problems:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>The company was rightly reluctant to share the entire dataset
with outsiders, and in turn we didn’t want to be responsible for
carefully guarding all their data.</p></li><li><p>Even if we did get a sample of their data, as more users used
their product, the amount of data they had was sure to grow.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">We therefore got only a sampling of their full data, and from this had
to make some prediction on how long it would take to run the analytics
on subsets (e.g., those corresponding to just one region) or all of
their data set, both today and as it grew over time.</div><p>Debbie was given 100,000 data points.  She broke them down into input
sets of 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 data points, ran her tools
on each input size, and plotted the result.</p><p>From this graph we have a good bet at guessing how long the tool would
take on a dataset of 50,000.  It’s much harder, however, to be sure
how long it would take on datasets of size 1.5 million or 3 million or
10 million.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">These processes are respectively called
<span style="font-style: italic">interpolation</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">extrapolation</span>.</span></span></span>  We’ve already explained
why we couldn’t get more data from the company.  So what could we do?</p><p>As another problem, suppose we have multiple implementations
available. When we plot their running time, say the graphs look like
this, with red, green, and blue each representing different
implementations. On small inputs, suppose the running times look like
this:</p><p><img src="../Images/1fe6a875e4a9f3d3a6f962c860dda585.png" alt="image" width="400.0" height="400.0" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/pict.png"/></p><p>This doesn’t seem to help us distinguish between the
implementations. Now suppose we run the algorithms on larger inputs,
and we get the following graphs:</p><p><img src="../Images/e4ff72c49a10103cea5fe1690ae0b404.png" alt="image" width="400.0" height="400.0" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/pict_2.png"/></p><p>Now we seem to have a clear winner (red), though it’s not clear there
is much to give between the other two (blue and green). But if we
calculate on even larger inputs, we start to see dramatic differences:</p><p><img src="../Images/d9aeccc8e556d7c4435cdf97c958a74d.png" alt="image" width="400.0" height="400.0" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/pict_3.png"/></p><p>In fact, the functions that resulted in these lines were the same in
all three figures. What these pictures tell us is that it is
dangerous to extrapolate too much from the performance on small
inputs. If we could obtain closed-form descriptions of the performance
of computations, it would be nice if we could compare them
better. That is what we will do in the next section.</p><blockquote class="RespCS"><p class="RespCSHeader">Responsible Computing: Choose Analysis Artifacts Wisely</p><blockquote class="RespCSBody"><p>As more and more decisions are guided by statistical analyses of data
(performed by humans), it’s critical to recognize that data can be a
poor proxy for the actual phenomenon that we seek to understand. Here,
Debbie had data about program behavior, which led to
mis-interpretations regarding which program is best. But Debbie also
had the programs themselves, from which the data were
generated. Analyzing the programs, rather than the data, is a more
direct approach to assessing the performance of a program.</p><p>While the rest of this chapter is about analyzing programs as written
in code, this point carries over to non-programs as well. You might
want to understand the effectiveness of a process for triaging
patients at a hospital, for example. In that case, you have both the
policy documents (rules which may or may not have been turned into a
software program to support managing patients) and data on the
effectiveness of using that process. Responsible computing tells us to
analyze both the process and its behavioral data, against knowledge
about best practices in patient care, to evaluate the effectiveness of
systems.</p></blockquote></blockquote>&#13;

data points as possible, extrapolate, and apply statistics to reason
about the most likely outcome.  Sometimes we can do that in computer
science, too, but fortunately we computer scientists have an enormous
advantage over most other sciences: instead of measuring a black-box
process, we have full access to its internals, namely the source code.
This enables us to apply <span style="font-style: italic">analytical</span> methods.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">“Analytical”
means applying algebraic and other mathematical methods to make
predictive statements about a process without running it.</span></span></span>  The answer
we compute this way is complementary to what we obtain from the above
experimental analysis, and in practice we will usually want to use a
combination of the two to arrive a strong understanding of the
program’s behavior.</p><p>The analytical idea is startlingly simple.  We look at the source of
the program and list the operations it performs.  For each operation,
we look up what it costs.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">We are going to focus on one kind of
cost, namely running time.  There are many other other kinds of costs
one can compute. We might naturally be interested in space (memory)
consumed, which tells us how big a machine we need to buy. We might
also care about power, this tells us the cost of our energy bills, or
of bandwidth, which tells us what kind of Internet connection we will
need.  In general, then, we’re interested in <span class="emph">resource
consumption</span>.  In short, don’t make the mistake of equating
“performance” with “speed”: the costs that matter depend on the
context in which the application runs.</span></span></span>  We add up these costs for all
the operations.  This gives us a total cost for the program.</p><p>Naturally, for most programs the answer will not be a constant number.
Rather, it will depend on factors such as the size of the input.
Therefore, our answer is likely to be an expression in terms of
parameters (such as the input’s size).  In other words, our answer will
be a function.</p><p>There are many functions that can describe the running-time of a
function.  Often we want an <span style="font-style: italic">upper bound</span> on the running time:
i.e., the actual number of operations will always be no more than what
the function predicts.  This tells us the maximum resource we will
need to allocate.  Another function may present a <span style="font-style: italic">lower bound</span>,
which tells us the least resource we need.  Sometimes we want an
<span style="font-style: italic">average-case analysis</span>.  And so on.  In this text we will focus
on upper-bounds, but keep in mind that all these other analyses are
also extremely valuable.</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>It is incorrect to speak of “the” upper-bound function, because

programs.  We are interested in the cost of running a program, which
is tantamount to studying the expressions of a program.  Simply making
a definition does not cost anything; the cost is incurred only when we
use a definition.</p><p>We will use a very simple (but sufficiently accurate) cost model:
every operation costs one unit of time in addition to the time needed
to evaluate its sub-expressions.  Thus it takes one unit of time to
look up a variable or to allocate a constant.  Applying primitive
functions also costs one unit of time.  Everything else is a compound
expression with sub-expressions.  The cost of a compound expression is
one plus that of each of its sub-expressions.  For instance, the
running time cost of the expression <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e1 + e2</code></span> (for some
sub-expressions <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e1</code></span> and <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e2</code></span>) is the running time for
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e1</code></span> + the running time for <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">e2</code></span> + 1.  Thus the expression
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">17 + 29</code></span> has a cost of 3 (one for each sub-expression and one
for the addition); the expression <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">1 + (7 * (2 / 9))</code></span> costs 7.</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">As you can see, there are two big approximations here:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>First, we are using an abstract rather than concrete notion of
time.  This is unhelpful in terms of estimating the so-called “wall
clock” running time of a program, but then again, that number depends
on numerous factors—<wbr/>not just what kind of processor and how much
memory you have, but even what other tasks are running on your
computer at the same time.  In contrast, abstract time units are more
portable.</p></li><li><p>Second, not every operation takes the same number of machine
cycles, whereas we have charged all of them the same number of
abstract time units.  As long as the actual number of cycles each one
takes is bounded by a constant factor of the number taken by another,
this will not pose any mathematical problems for reasons we will soon
understand [<a href="#%28part._big-oh-def%29" data-pltdoc="x">Comparing Functions</a>].</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">Of course, it is instructive—<wbr/>after carefully settting up the
experimental conditions—<wbr/>to make an analytical prediction of a program’s
behavior and then verify it against what the implementation actually
does.  If the analytical prediction is accurate, we can reconstruct
the constant factors hidden in our calculations and thus obtain very
precise wall-clock time bounds for the program.</div><p>There is one especially tricky kind of expression: <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">if</code></span> (and its fancier
cousins, like <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">cases</code></span> and <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">ask</code></span>). How do we think about the cost of
an <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">if</code></span>? It always evaluates the condition. After that, it evaluates only
<span class="emph">one</span> of its branches. But we are interested in the <span style="font-style: italic">worst case</span> time,
i.e., what is the longest it could take? For a conditional, it’s the cost of
the condition added to the cost of the <span class="emph">maximum</span> of the two
branches.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="heading">14.4<span class="stt"> </span><a name="(part._size-of-input)"/>The Size of the Input<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._size-of-input)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h3><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">We

the <span class="emph">value</span> of a number is exponentially larger than its

Though irrelevant here,
when numbers are central—<wbr/>e.g., when testing
primality—<wbr/>the difference becomes critical! We will return to
this briefly later [<a href="avoid-recomp.html#%28part._numbers-not-constant%29" data-pltdoc="x">The Complexity of Numbers</a>].</span></span></span></p><p>It can be subtle to define the size of the argument.  Suppose a
function consumes a list of numbers; it would be natural to define the
size of its argument to be the length of the list, i.e., the number of
<span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">link</code></span>s in the list.  We could also define it to be twice as
large, to account for both the <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">link</code></span>s and the individual
numbers (but as we’ll see [<a href="#%28part._big-oh-def%29" data-pltdoc="x">Comparing Functions</a>], constants usually don’t matter).
But suppose a function consumes a list of music albums, and each music
album is itself a list of songs, each of which has information about
singers and so on.  Then how we measure the size depends on what part
of the input the function being analyzed actually examines.  If, say,
it only returns the length of the list of albums, then it is
indifferent to what each list element contains [<a href="processing-lists.html#%28part._polymorphic-data%29" data-pltdoc="x">Monomorphic Lists and Polymorphic Types</a>],
and only the length of the list of albums matters.  If, however, the
function returns a list of all the singers on every album, then it
traverses all the way down to individual songs, and we have to account
for all these data.  In short, we care about the size of <span class="emph">the
data potentially accessed by the function</span>.</p>&#13;

\(T(k) = 3 + 3 + 5 + T(k-1)\) (respectively from the first question,
the second question, the remaining operations in the second answer,

operations, with different actual running times, into a cost of one.
So perhaps we should not worry too much about the differences between,
say, \([k \rightarrow 11k + 4]\) and \([k \rightarrow 4k + 10]\).  If
we were given two implementations with these running times, respectively, it’s
likely that we would pick other characteristics to choose between
them.</p><p>What this boils down to is being able to compare two
functions (representing the performance of implementations) for
whether one is somehow quantitatively better in some meaningful
sense than the other: i.e., is the quantitative difference so great
that it might lead to a qualitative one.  The
example above suggests that small differences in constants probably
do not matter.</p><p>That is, we want a way to compare two functions, \(f_1\) and
\(f_2\). What does it mean for \(f_1\) to be “less” than \(f_2\),

will always be less than the value of \(f_2\). However, to accommodate
our intution that multiplicative constants don’t matter, the
definition allows the value of \(f_2\) at all points to be multiplied
by some constant \(c\) to achieve the inequality. Observe, however,
that \(c\) is <span class="emph">independent</span> of \(n\): it is chosen once and must
then work for the infinite number of values. In practice, this means
that the presence of \(c\) lets us bypass some number of early values
where \(f_1\) might have a greater value than \(f_2\), so long as,
after a point, \(f_2\) dominates \(f_1\).</p><p/><div class="SIntrapara">This definition has more flexibility than we might initially think.

the order, it would mean that for every point along the number line,
there must exist a constant—<wbr/>and there pretty much always does!  The swapped

Thus if \(g \leq f\),
we can write \(g \in O(f)\), which we can read as “\(f\) is an

Obviously, the “bigger” function is likely to be a less useful bound
than a “tighter” one.  That said, it is conventional to write a
“minimal” bound for functions, which means avoiding unnecessary
constants, sum terms, and so on. The justification for this is given
below [<a href="#%28part._big-oh-closure%29" data-pltdoc="x">Combining Big-Oh Without Woe</a>].</div><p/><div class="SIntrapara">Pay especially close attention to our

one, i.e., roughly one per <span title="Pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">cases</code></span> clause.  In what follows, we
will ignore the base cases so long as the size of the input is
constant (such as zero or one), because in such cases the amount of
work done will also be a constant, which we can generally ignore
