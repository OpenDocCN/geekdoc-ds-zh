- en: 'Having established the capability to evaluate the Incremental Potential for
    arbitrary configurations, we now turn our attention to the implementation of the
    optimization time integrator. This integrator is crucial for minimizing the Incremental
    Potential, which in turn updates the nodal positions and velocities. This implementation
    follows the approach outlined in [Algorithm 3.3.1](lec3.3-grad_based_opt.html#alg:lec3:PN_method_IE):'

    method with line search ([Algorithm 3.3.1](lec3.3-grad_based_opt.html#alg:lec3:PN_method_IE)),
    and we implemented the Incremental Potential value (`IP_val()`), gradient (`IP_grad()`),
    and Hessian (`IP_hess()`) evaluations as separate functions for clarity.

- en: For the computation of search directions, we utilize the linear solver from
    the [Scipy library](https://scipy.org/), which is adept at handling sparse matrices.
    Notably, this solver accepts matrices in the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.
    The choice of this format and solver is driven by their efficiency in processing
    and memory usage, which is particularly advantageous when dealing with large-scale
    problems with large sparse matricies often encountered in computational simulations.
