    contact handling method based on Implicit Contact Prediction (IPC).

- en: In 3D, both distance and friction basis computations become more complex. These
    computations rely on point-triangle and edge-edge primitive pairs, similar to
    the point-edge pairs used in 2D.

- en: For edge-edge distances, which are only C0-continuous, an additional mollification
    function that smoothly decreases to zero is necessary. This function is multiplied
    with the barrier energy density function to achieve C1-continuity, enabling the
    use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods.

- en: Due to the significantly larger number of primitive pairs in 3D, spatial data
    structures like spatial hashing or bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) are often
    used in the broad phase to filter candidates before computing distances or performing
    CCD.
