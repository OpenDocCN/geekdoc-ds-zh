For instance, `(Table \\@ref(tab:docvisittablermarkdown))` will produce: ([Table E.1](#tbl-docvisittablermarkdown)). In this case we specify ‘tab’ before the unique reference to the table, so that R Markdown knows that it is a table. For tables we need to include the caption in the main content, as a ‘caption’, rather than in a ‘fig.cap’ chunk option as is the case for figures.\n\nTable E.1: Number of visits to the doctor in the past two weeks, based on the 1977–1978 Australian Health Survey\n\n| visits | n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 | 4141 |\n| 1 | 782 |\n| 2 | 174 |\n| 3 | 30 |\n| 4 | 24 |\n| 5 | 9 |\n| 6 | 12 |\n| 7 | 12 |\n| 8 | 5 |\n| 9 | 1 |\n\nFinally, we can also cross-reference equations. To that we need to add a tag `(\\#eq:macroidentity)` which we then reference. For instance, use `Equation \\@ref(eq:macroidentity).` to produce ([Equation E.1](#eq-gdpmacroidentity))\n\n```"]
