    world of computers, where we use discrete numbers for representation, a range
    of interesting methods arises.

    as {x∈R3 ∣ ∥x−c∥≤r, c∈R3, r>0}, centered at point \( \mathbf{c} \) with radius
    \( r \). This approach extends beyond spheres to include shapes like half-spaces,
    boxes, ellipsoids, tori, and others, characterized by their *interior* using functions
    such as signed distances. However, parametrization faces challenges when handling
    complex geometries that are frequently encountered in real-world scenarios. An
    emerging exception to this limitation is the use of advanced neural representations
    employing neural networks. These newer methods show promise in effectively representing
    more intricate geometrical forms.

    on and inside the object. But points alone aren't enough; we typically need to
    establish connectivity between them to define the object’s boundaries for applications
    like rendering and 3D printing. Monitoring how a cluster of points shifts over
    time also helps in measuring deformation.

    Digitally, this continuity must be represented discretely, usually through defining
    the **connectivity** of the solid's geometry.

    representing solid geometries, such as voxel-based approaches. These methods divide
    the space into a 3D grid of small boxes, or voxels, with each voxel representing
    a segment of the object, similar to pixels in a 2D image. Voxel-based methods
    are advantageous for several reasons. Firstly, they can act as a discrete level
    set representation, capable of modeling complex geometries and tracking their
    evolution over time. Each voxel contains information about its position relative
    to the object''s surface, offering an efficient discrete approximation of the
    continuous level set function. This is beneficial for algorithms involved in surface
    evolution, shape optimization, and collision detection. Secondly, voxel-based
    approaches are conducive to Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) operations. This
    technique in solid modeling uses Boolean operators to combine simpler shapes into
    complex 3D models. The voxelized framework allows for straightforward and efficient
    execution of operations like union, intersection, and difference on the voxel
    grid. This enables the easy creation and modification of intricate shapes.'

    connecting points with edges or triangles is a popular technique in computational
    geometry. This concept is illustrated in the accompanying figure, where the left
    and middle images show two different meshes. Notably, even though these meshes
    utilize the same sampled points or nodes, they have distinct connectivities, resulting
    in different shapes. The rightmost mesh in the figure demonstrates a transformation
    from one shape to another. This mesh represents a deformation of the middle mesh,
    achieved by vertically compressing its upper half.'

    in our spatial representation, we record the extent of solid matter at each node
    location. This allows us to use our sampled points to calculate the density of
    the solid at each grid node. This method is beneficial for quantifying the solid''s
    distribution within the grid and for establishing a network of connectivity among
    the original sampled points. Refer to the accompanying figure for a visual demonstration
    of this concept. In the figure, the sampled points are depicted as green dots.
    The grid nodes, where we record solid densities, are shown as black circles. These
    nodes are connected through the grid, illustrated with blue lines.'

- en: In the field of modern solid simulation, the described methods of defining connectivity
    are crucial. The first method, establishing connections through a mesh of edges
    or triangles, is foundational to Finite Element Method (FEM) simulators. The second
    approach, which involves using a uniform grid to compute solid density and establish
    connectivity, is integral to Material Point Method (MPM) simulators [[Jiang et
    al. 2016]](bibliography.html#jiang2016material). This book largely concentrates
    on the former method, delving into the intricacies of FEM. The mesh-based structure
    of FEM is particularly effective in handling complex domains by breaking them
    down into simpler elements. This makes FEM an essential tool in the study and
    simulation of deformable solids, and understanding its nuances is vital for those
    engaged in this area of study.

    might appear redundant. Yet, this dual approach gives MPM a significant edge,
    especially in simulating dynamic events like solid fractures. In such cases, FEM
    would necessitate meticulous modification of the edges and elements that define
    the original connectivity to accurately depict the damage. In contrast, MPM efficiently
    handles these scenarios. The uniform grid naturally accommodates the separation
    of body parts in a fracture, as the lack of material at fracture nodes leads to
    an automatic disconnection of adjacent grid nodes. This attribute allows MPM to
    excel in managing changes in solid topology.

    (FEM) excels. FEM operates directly on the mesh, obviating the need for constant
    information transfer, thus ensuring greater precision. This level of accuracy
    makes FEM an invaluable resource in the precise simulation of deformable solids,
    which is the primary emphasis of this book.

    vector, denoted as \( x\in\mathbb{R}^{dn} \) (refer to the figure below), provides
    an effective means to describe a specific geometric configuration, given a constant
    connectivity. In this representation, \(d\) indicates the dimension of space (1,
    2, or 3), and \(n\) represents the total number of points. Similarly, attributes
    like velocity, acceleration, and forces at each sample point can be amalgamated
    into corresponding extended vectors, symbolized as \(v\), \(a\), and \(f\) respectively.
    This organized approach to data presentation not only aids in comprehensively
    understanding the various parameters and their interrelations but also streamlines
    the mathematical formulation of the simulation process.
