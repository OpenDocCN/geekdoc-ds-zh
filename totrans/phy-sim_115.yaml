- en: We implemented semi-implicit friction in 2D based on squared unsigned distances
    of point-edge pairs and incorporated it into the time-stepping optimization.

- en: We began by making the friction force integrable in the continuous setting through
    semi-implicit temporal discretization and a smooth approximation of the dynamic-static
    friction transition. The spatial discretization of the approximate friction potential
    follows a similar approach to the barrier potential.

- en: Next, we examined the computation of the normal force magnitude λ, normal direction
    n, and barycentric coordinate r of the closest point for point-edge pairs. These
    values are calculated at the beginning of each time step and remain constant during
    the optimization. It is important to note that the set of point-edge pairs for
    friction is also constant per optimization and differs from the set used for the
    barrier.

- en: Finally, we implemented the computation of the discrete friction potential and
    its derivatives. We used relative velocities v^k​ as intermediate variables and
    applied the chain rule to organize the calculations.

    solid simulator with inversion-free elastodynamics and interpenetration-free frictional
    self-contact. Next, we will explore the additional steps needed to extend these
    concepts to 3D!
