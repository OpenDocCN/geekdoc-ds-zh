- en: We have successfully implemented a minimal yet complete 2D Material Point Method
    (MPM) simulation featuring two colliding elastic blocks. This setup showcases
    the core pipeline of MPM, including particle sampling, data structure initialization,
    PIC-based transfer schemes, and elastic deformation based on the StVK constitutive
    model in Hencky strain space.

    as a clean and extensible foundation for building more sophisticated MPM systems.

    transfer scheme, Drucker-Prager plasticity, and SDF-based boundary handling to
    simulate 2D sand interacting with a static sphere collider, enabling realistic
    modeling of granular materials with frictional contact.
