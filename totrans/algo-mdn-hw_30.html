Therefore, in this chapter, we will discuss number representations and their use in numerical algorithms.</p></article><div class="nextprev"><div class="left"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/profiling/noise/" id="prev-article">← Getting Accurate Results</a><br/><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/profiling/">← ../Profiling</a></div><div class="right"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/arithmetic/float/" id="next-article">Floating-Point Numbers →</a><br/><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/number-theory/">../Number Theory →</a></div></div>
