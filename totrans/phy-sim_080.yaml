    and the corresponding optimization problems (refer to Equation [(2.1.1)](lec2.1-opt_time_integration.html#eq:lec2:optimization_IE))
    utilized in solids simulation are derived by discretizing the conservation laws—our
    governing equations—from their continuous forms. This chapter will explore the
    derivation of both the strong and weak forms of these conservation laws. We will
    then discuss the methods for their temporal and spatial discretizations, which
    are essential for formulating the discrete problems we aim to solve.

    of mass and the conservation of momentum (Newton's Second Law). We will outline
    these equations below and provide detailed derivations later in this lecture.

    the velocity defined over X, the equations are [[Gonzalez & Stuart 2008]](bibliography.html#gonzalez2008first):
    R(X,t)J(X,t)=R(X,0)R(X,0)∂t∂V​(X,t)=∇X⋅P(X,t)+R(X,0)g​Conservation of mass,Conservation of momentum,​​
    where X∈Ω0​ and t≥0. Here R is the mass density, J(X,t)=detF(X,t), P is the first
    Piola-Kirchoff stress, and g is the constant gravitational acceleration. Note
    that J(X,0)=1, and the mass conservation can also be written as ∂t∂​(R(X,t)J(X,t))=0.'

    we will also derive the equivalent weak form of the force balance equation (conservation
    of momentum). The weak form reformulates the conservation law using integral expressions,
    which are crucial for the subsequent derivation of the temporal and spatial discretizations
    of the equations using the Finite Element Method.
