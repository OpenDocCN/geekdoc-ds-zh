- en: After examining the convergence issues of traditional Newton's method, even
    on smooth convex energies, we introduced a backtracking **line search** scheme
    for minimizing the Incremental Potential of Implicit Euler time integration, ensuring
    global convergence.

- en: To guarantee the discovery of a positive step size, the Incremental Potential
    Hessian is projected onto a nearby Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix. This
    **SPD projection** is efficiently achieved by eliminating the negative eigenvalues
    of the Hessian matrices for each non-convex energy stencil, involving only a few
    nodes.

    for setting tolerance is also introduced, utilizing the Newton search direction.
