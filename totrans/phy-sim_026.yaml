- en: We now rewrite the 2D mass-spring simulator to leverage GPU acceleration. Instead
    of directly writing [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), we resort
    to [MUDA](https://github.com/MuGdxy/muda), a lightweight library that provides
    a simple interface for GPU-accelerated computations.

- en: The architecture of the GPU-accelerated simulator is similar to the Python version.
    All function and variable names are consistent with the Numpy version. However,
    the implementation details are different due to the GPU architecture and programming
    model. Before delving into the details, let's first get a feeling of the speedup
    that GPU could bring us from the following gif ([Figure 4.6.1](#fig:lec4:cpu_vs_gpu)).

    and their derivatives on the GPU. Computations are then performed directly on
    the GPU, and only the necessary position information is transferred back to the
    CPU for control and rendering. A more efficient implementation could render directly
    on the GPU, eliminating even this data transfer, but for simplicity and readability,
    we have not implemented that here.

    as all the necessary parameters are stored in a `DeviceBuffer` object, which is
    a wrapper of the CUDA device memory implemented by the MUDA library. This allows
    us to perform computations directly on the GPU without the need for data transfer
    between the CPU and GPU.

    is implemented, performing necessary computations on the GPU while controlling
    the process on the CPU. Any variable begin with `device_` here is a `DeviceBuffer`
    object on the GPU. To print the values in `DeviceBuffer` for debugging purposes,
    the common practice is to transfer the data back to the CPU, or call the `display_vec`
    function (which calls `printf` in parallel on the GPU) implemented in `uti.cu`.
