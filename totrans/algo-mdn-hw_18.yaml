- en: 'Before jumping straight to compiler optimizations, which is what most of this
    chapter is about, let’s briefly recap the “big picture” first. Skipping the boring
    parts, there are 4 stages of turning C programs into executables:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Preprocessing** expands macros, pulls included source from header files,
    and strips off comments from source code: `gcc -E source.c` (outputs preprocessed
    source to stdout)'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Compiling** parses the source, checks for syntax errors, converts it into
    an intermediate representation, performs optimizations, and finally translates
    it into assembly language: `gcc -S file.c` (emits an `.s` file)'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Assembly** turns assembly language into machine code, except that any external
    function calls like `printf` are substituted with placeholders: `gcc -c file.c`
    (emits an `.o` file, called *object file*)'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Linking** finally resolves the function calls by plugging in their actual
    addresses, and produces an executable binary: `gcc -o binary file.c`'

- en: We have the last [stage](../stages), linking, because it is is both easier and
    faster to compile programs on a file-by-file basis and then link those files together
    — this way you can do this in parallel and also cache intermediate results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It also gives the ability to distribute code as *libraries*, which can be either
    *static* or *shared*:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Static* libraries are simply collections of precompiled object files that
    are merged with other sources by the compiler to produce a single executable,
    just as it normally would.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Dynamic* or *shared* libraries are precompiled executables that have additional
    meta-information about where their callables are, references to which are resolved
    during runtime. As the name suggests, this allows *sharing* the compiled binaries
    between multiple programs.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main advantage of using static libraries is that you can perform various
    *interprocedural optimizations* that require more context than just the signatures
    of library functions, such as [function inlining](/hpc/architecture/functions)
    or dead code elimination. To force the linker to look for and only accept static
    libraries, you can pass the `-static` option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This process is called *link-time optimization (LTO)*, and it is possible because
    modern compilers also store some form of *intermediate representation* in object
    files, which allows them to perform certain lightweight optimizations on the program
    as a whole. This also allows using different compiled languages in the same program,
    which can even be optimized across language barriers if their compilers use the
    same intermediate representation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LTO is a relatively recent feature (it appeared in GCC only around 2014), and
    it is still far from perfect. In C and C++, the way to make sure no performance
    is lost due to separate compilation is to create a *header-only library*. As the
    name suggests, they are just header files that contain full definitions of all
    functions, and so by simply including them, the compiler gets access to all optimizations
    possible. Although you do have to recompile the library code from scratch each
    time, this approach retains full control and makes sure that no performance is
    lost.

    happening in your program.

- en: You can get assembly from the source by passing the `-S` flag to the compiler,
    which will then generate a human-readable `*.s` file. If you pass `-fverbose-asm`,
    this file will also contain compiler comments about source code line numbers and
    some info about variables being used. If it is just a little snippet and you are
    feeling lazy, you can use [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/), which is
    a very handy online tool that converts source code to assembly, highlights logical
    asm blocks by color, includes a small x86 instruction set reference, and also
    has a large selection of other compilers, targets, and languages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from the assembly, the other most helpful level of abstraction is the
    intermediate representation on which compilers perform optimizations. The IR defines
    the flow of computation itself and is much less dependent on architecture features
    like the number of registers or a particular instruction set. It is often useful
    to inspect these to get insight into how the compiler *sees* your program, but
    this is a bit out of the scope of this book.

- en: We will mainly use [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) in this chapter, but also try
    to duplicate examples for [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) when necessary. The
    two compilers are largely compatible with each other, for the most part only differing
    in some optimization flags and minor syntax details. [← ../Compilation](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/)[Flags
