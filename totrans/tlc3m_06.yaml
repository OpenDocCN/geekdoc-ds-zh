    they obeyed. They did not understand, yet they answered. In their turning and
    alignment, one could glimpse an unsettling promise — that thought, once the sacred
    flame of mind, might be captured in matter. In a Europe newly addicted to precision
    — of trade, taxation, and truth — these inventions were less curiosities than
    necessities. Each rod and cog carried within it a revolution: the idea that calculation
    could be externalized, that the burden of reason could be shared by things.'

    serial instruction to massive parallelism, precision to probability. The mind,
    he admitted, might not compute as his machine did — yet the analogy illuminated
    both.

    systems that learn, adapt, and approximate truth rather than deduce it.
