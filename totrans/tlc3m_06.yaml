    first mechanical minds were carved from bone and brass. They were not alive, yet
    they obeyed. They did not understand, yet they answered. In their turning and
    alignment, one could glimpse an unsettling promise — that thought, once the sacred
    flame of mind, might be captured in matter. In a Europe newly addicted to precision
    — of trade, taxation, and truth — these inventions were less curiosities than
    necessities. Each rod and cog carried within it a revolution: the idea that calculation
    could be externalized, that the burden of reason could be shared by things.'

    Wilhelm Leibniz dreamed of a world where reason itself could be mechanized. To
    him, thought was not chaos but calculus — a dance of symbols governed by laws
    as immutable as gravity. Where Pascal saw arithmetic as labor, Leibniz saw logic
    as liberation: if truth could be encoded, then the universe could be computed.
    His ambition was audacious: to create a machine that not only added and subtracted
    but reasoned — a device that could, in principle, settle all disputes, prove all
    theorems, and reveal all truths.'

    messages hurled through air, light, or ether. Smoke and semaphore, drums and couriers,
    flags and fires — each sought to extend the voice beyond its reach. Yet all remained
    bounded by line of sight, by wind and weather.
