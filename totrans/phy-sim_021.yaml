- en: In representing solid geometries, we employ a mesh structure. We can further
    simplify the representation by connecting nodes on the mesh with edges. To facilitate
    this process, especially for geometries like squares, we can script a mesh generator.
    This generator allows for specifying both the side length of the square and the
    desired resolution of the mesh.

- en: In the code, `n_seg` represents the number of edges along each side of the square.
    The nodes are uniformly distributed across the square and interconnected through
    horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edges. For instance, calling `generate(1.0,
    4)` constructs a mesh as depicted in [Figure 4.1.1](#fig:lec4:square_mesh_4x4).
    This implementation utilizes the array data structures from the [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
    library, which provides convenient methods for handling the vector algebra required
    in subsequent steps.

    Incremental Potential, which needs to be minimized in time step \(n\), is represented
    as follows: E(x)=21​∥x−(xn+hvn)∥M2​+h2P(x).(4.1.1) Next, our focus shifts to implementing
    the calculations for the energy value, gradient, and Hessian for both the inertia
    term and the potential energy \(P(x)\).'
