    University Press. It is available to order [here](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Data-Science-Applications/dp/1009509403).
    This online version will remain available and maintained. Additional resources
    can be found on the [publisher’s website](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/mathematical-methods-in-data-science/6CB866F77A7CA33109EF99910CFA40BC#overview).
    See [here](_downloads/ce7e6d2ce9860e91819b59729a250d5d/MMiDS_Errata.pdf) for a
    list of typos. The book is based on Jupyter notebooks that were developed for
    [MATH 535: Mathematical Methods in Data Science](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/mmids/),
    a one-semester advanced undergraduate and master’s level course offered at [UW-Madison](https://math.wisc.edu/).
    The online version was generated using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/).

- en: Content-wise it is a second course in **multivariable calculus**, **linear algebra**,
    and **probability** motivated by and illustrated on data science applications.
    As such, the reader is expected to be familiar with the basics of those areas,
    as well as to have been exposed to proofs – but no knowledge of data science is
    assumed. Moreover, while the emphasis is on the mathematical concepts and methods,
    coding is used throughout. Basic familiarity with [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
    will suffice. The book provides an introduction to some specialized packages,
    especially [Numpy](https://numpy.org), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

    notebooks are also available in slideshow format. The slideshows were created
    using Jupyter; hence, instructors can create their own tailored version directly
    from the notebooks.
