- en: The table of events that is used as a running example throughout [Processing
    Tables](processing-tables.html) now has an additional column with a zip code.
    Zip codes raise the idea of data that appear numeric but should be treated categorically.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The version of the table without the zip codes remains intact at the URL and
    Google Sheet ID used in earlier editions of the book (so any prior code will continue
    to work). The code snippets in the 2025-08-27 edition have been updated to include
    the zip code column. They also use references to new versions of the Google Sheet
    and CSV files that include the column.

- en: The preface includes information on using Pyret within VSCode (as an alternative
    to CPO). The only difference between these two tools lies in how tables are imported
    from external sources. CPO imports tables from Google Sheets, whereas VSCode imports
    tables from CSV files (either via URLs or file paths).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in VSCode (specifically, if they import CSV files), a border and VSCode logo will

- en: A section on `for each` iterators in Pyret has been added to the end of [From
    Pyret to Python](intro-python.html). This placement supports courses that wish
    to make the transition to Python after learning how to process lists in Pyret,
    without disrupting the flow for those who switch to Python after covering trees
    (the originally-envisioned flow).

    rest of the section and subsection titles consistent with the "mutation" terminology,
    we also renamed several of them to use the term "mutation" rather than the more
    colloquial "updating" that had been used previously.
