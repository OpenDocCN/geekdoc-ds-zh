- en: 'When discussing [general slip boundary conditions](lec6.3-general_slip_DBC.html),
    we introduced the usage of singular value decomposition (SVD). Here, we apply
    a variant known as **Polar SVD** ([Algorithm 13.2.1](#alg:lec13:polar_SVD)) to
    decompose F: F=UΣVT, where U and V are both d×d rotation matrices, and Σ is a
    d×d diagonal matrix. Unlike standard SVD, which ensures Σii​ remains non-negative
    possibly at the expense of having det(U)=−1 or det(V)=−1, Polar SVD maintains
    det(U)=1 and det(V)=1, allowing Σii​ to be negative if necessary.'

- en: Polar SVD is named for its relation to Polar decomposition, where F is expressed
    as RS. This decomposition can be reconstructed via R=UVT and S=VΣVT, with R representing
    the closest rotation to F and S being symmetric.

- en: The Polar SVD of F offers a more intuitive way to understand deformation. If
    we denote σi​=Σii​, referred to as the **principal stretches**, we can conceptualize
    F as comprising a sequence of transformations. Initially, there is a rotation
    by VT, followed by scaling the dimensions by σi​ along each axis, and concluding
    with another rotation by U. This decomposition is applicable for all possible
    F.

    energy density functions using σi​ exclusively. For instance, our intuitive formulation
