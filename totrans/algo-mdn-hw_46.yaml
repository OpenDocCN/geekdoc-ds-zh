    a cost model that is more sensitive to expensive block I/O operations but is not
    too rigorous to still be useful.

- en: In the [standard RAM model](/hpc/complexity), we ignore the fact that primitive
    operations take unequal time to complete. Most importantly, it does not differentiate
    between operations on different types of memory, equating a read from RAM taking
    ~50ns in real-time with a read from HDD taking ~5ms, or about a $10^5$ times as
    much.

    that is not an I/O operation. More specifically, we consider one level of cache
    hierarchy and assume the following about the hardware and the problem:'

    we can read and write in blocks of $B$ elements in a unit time (reading a whole
    block and just one element takes the same time).

    *I/O operations*, or *IOPS* — that is, the total number of blocks read or written
    to external memory during execution.

- en: We will mostly focus on the case where the internal memory is RAM and the external
    memory is SSD or HDD, although the underlying analysis techniques that we will
    develop are applicable to any layer in the cache hierarchy. Under these settings,
    reasonable block size $B$ is about 1MB, internal memory size $M$ is usually a
    few gigabytes, and $N$ is up to a few terabytes.

    it one element at a time, we implicitly load it by chunks of $O(B)$ elements and,

    model, the complexity of summation and other linear array scans is $$ SCAN(N)

    Even when the data is just redirected to the standard input from a normal file,
    the operating system buffers its stream and reads it in blocks of ~4KB (by default).
