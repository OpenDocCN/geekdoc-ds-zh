<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/Release_Notes.html">https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/Release_Notes.html</a></blockquote><p>This is a summary of updates made with each release of the book
(excluding typos and other minor fixes).</p><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 31.1"><h3 class="heading">31.1 <a name="(part._.Version_2025-08-27)"/>Version 2025-08-27<a href="#(part._.Version_2025-08-27)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>This version has several small but potentially significant changes:</p><ul><li><p>The table of events that is used as a running example throughout
<a href="processing-tables.html" data-pltdoc="x">Processing Tables</a> now has an additional column with a zip
code. Zip codes raise the idea of data that appear numeric but should
be treated categorically.</p><p>The version of the table without the zip codes remains intact at the
URL and Google Sheet ID used in earlier editions of the book (so any prior code will
continue to work). The code snippets in the 2025-08-27 edition have
been updated to include the zip code column. They also use references
to new versions of the Google Sheet and CSV files that include the
column.</p></li><li><p>The preface includes information on using Pyret within VSCode (as
an alternative to CPO). The only difference between these two tools
lies in how tables are imported from external sources. CPO imports
tables from Google Sheets, whereas VSCode imports tables from CSV
files (either via URLs or file paths).</p><p>The book uses CPO as the default presentation. When code examples can
run only in VSCode (specifically, if they import CSV files), a border
and VSCode logo will surround the code.</p></li><li><p>A section on <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">for each</code> iterators in Pyret has been added
to the end of <a href="intro-python.html" data-pltdoc="x">From Pyret to Python</a>. This placement supports courses
that wish to make the transition to Python after learning how to
process lists in Pyret, without disrupting the flow for those who
switch to Python after covering trees (the originally-envisioned
flow).</p><p>Courses that make the switch to Python after trees will likely want to
skip the Pyret <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">for each</code> material.</p></li><li><p>There is a new chapter on <a href="python-fileio.html" data-pltdoc="x">File Input and Output in Python</a> at the end of
the <a href="part_pyret-to-python.html" data-pltdoc="x">From Pyret to Python</a> section of the book.</p><p>As a result of this addition, all subsequent chapter numbers have
increased by one beginning with those in the <a href="part_state.html" data-pltdoc="x">Programming with State (in Both Pyret and Python)</a>
section.</p></li><li><p>The two major sections in <a href="part_state.html" data-pltdoc="x">Programming with State (in Both Pyret and Python)</a> have been
renamed to <a href="mutating-structures.html" data-pltdoc="x">Mutating Structures</a> and <a href="mutating-variables.html" data-pltdoc="x">Mutating Variables</a> to make
their intents clearer. To keep the rest of the section and subsection
titles consistent with the "mutation" terminology, we also renamed
several of them to use the term "mutation" rather than the more
colloquial "updating" that had been used previously.</p><p>Renaming the sections also changes the URLs that reach these
subsections. Existing links to those sections will continue to work, as
URLs into the book include the release tag. However, any readers who plan
to update links to refer to the 2025-08-27 release should recheck URLs
into the <a href="part_state.html" data-pltdoc="x">Programming with State (in Both Pyret and Python)</a> section.</p></li></ul></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 31.2"><h3 class="heading">31.2 <a name="(part._.Version_2025-02-09)"/>Version 2025-02-09<a href="#(part._.Version_2025-02-09)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>This version introduces a new context, <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">dcic2024</code>, that contains

chapter that introduces tables.</p><p>Error corrections:
</p><ul><li><p>In <a href="Naming_Values.html#%28part._program-directory%29" data-pltdoc="x">The Program Directory</a>, corrected the description of what Pyret reports when a program

the book’s theme, the focus is (again) on data structures. The result,
