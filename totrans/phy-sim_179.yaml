- en: In this section, we explored fundamental approaches for solving large, sparse
    linear systems of the form Ax=b that arise in optimization-based simulation, particularly
    when computing search directions in Newton-type methods.

    we solve Pp=−∇E(x) where P is typically a symmetric positive definite (SPD) proxy
    matrix. This reduces to solving linear systems crucial for optimization time integrators.'

- en: Direct solvers provide exact solutions through matrix factorization. For SPD
    systems, Cholesky decomposition A=LLT reduces the problem to two triangular solves.
    While robust and accurate, direct methods become impractical for very large systems
    due to computational constraints.

- en: Iterative methods offer alternatives for large, sparse systems. Basic methods
    include Jacobi (naturally parallelizable) and Gauss-Seidel (faster convergence
    but sequential). Both converge when the spectral radius of their iteration matrices
    is less than 1\. The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is a more sophisticated approach
    for SPD systems. CG constructs A-conjugate search directions ensuring progress
    is never undone, achieving remarkable efficiency through orthogonality relationships.
    In exact arithmetic, CG converges in at most n steps, while in practice it often
    converges much faster with preconditioning.

- en: The choice between direct and iterative methods depends on problem size, sparsity
    structure, and accuracy requirements. Direct methods excel for moderate-sized
    problems requiring high precision, while iterative methods, particularly CG with
    preconditioning, are essential for large-scale simulations.
