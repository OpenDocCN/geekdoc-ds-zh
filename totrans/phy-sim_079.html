<p>We have successfully implemented an inversion-free 2D elasticity simulation by discretizing the Neo-Hookean model using linear triangle elements.</p>
<p>By maintaining a linearly varying displacement field within each triangle, we can directly calculate a constant deformation gradient <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6861em;"/><span class="mord mathbf">F</span></span></span></span> for each triangle using both the material and world space coordinates of the vertices. This foundational setup facilitates the computation of the Neo-Hookean energy, as well as its gradient and Hessian with respect to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"/><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span>, by applying the chain rule. These calculations are essential for the optimization-based time integration discussed in previous lectures.</p>
<p>To ensure the simulation remains free of both interpenetration and inversion, we adopt a similar strategy as previously described: the initial step size in the line search is determined by solving a quadratic equation for each triangle. This equation calculates a critical step size that reduces the triangle's volume by 90%. The smallest of these critical step sizes across all triangles is then used to initialize the line search, ensuring robustness against both non-interpenetration and non-inversion.</p>
<p>In the upcoming chapter, we will delve into the derivation of the governing equations for hyperelastic solids, providing a detailed explanation of each step to further solidify understanding.</p>
