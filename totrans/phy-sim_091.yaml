- en: 'To prevent self-interpenetration during simulation, it''s essential to enforce
    a condition ensuring that the deformation map ϕ(⋅,t):Ω0→Ωt is bijective for any
    t≥0. This bijection is maintained by boundary forces acting on pairs of contacting
    surface regions, referred to as ΓC​. We can think of these forces as another set
    of Neumann boundary conditions that exert extra forces on ΓC​ only when necessary
    to prevent interpenetration. Thus, we can extend the boundary integral term in
    the weak form as follows:'

- en: Similar to Dirichlet boundary conditions, TC​(X,t) can only be determined once
    we solve the problem. However, enforcing non-interpenetration is more complex
    than prescribing displacements. Fortunately, we can use the approximate constitutive
    model of TC​(X,t) in IPC to represent the contact force as a function of x, ensuring
    non-interpenetration by simply including this additional conservative force.

    with both ΓD​ and ΓN​. For a free (Neumann) boundary contacting a Dirichlet boundary,
    TC​(X,t) on the Dirichlet part will also be ignored when enforcing the Dirichlet
    boundary conditions. However, if two Dirichlet boundaries interpenetrate each
    other, the problem will have no solution with the bijectivity constraint.'
