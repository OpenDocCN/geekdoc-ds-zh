    to the implementations in [Filter Line Search](./lec8-filter_line_search.html)
    for boundary conditions and contact. Additionally, we have derived self-contact
    between discrete surfaces in 2D, which will be implemented in the next lecture.

    in the continuous setting was covered in [Boundary Conditions and Frictional Contact](./lec18-BC_and_fric.html).
    Its integral approximation can be performed similarly to normal contact forces
    (see [Case Study: 2D Frictional Self-Contact](./lec22-2d_self_fric.html) for details).'

    and then perform spatial discretization and approximation to obtain the nodal
    forces. Readers interested in this approach can refer to Lagrangian Mechanics
    or Hamiltonian Mechanics.
