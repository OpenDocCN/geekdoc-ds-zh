    the instruction set can be very fruitful, especially in the case of [CISC](/hpc/architecture/isa)
    platforms like x86, which currently has [somewhere between 1000 and 4000](https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/)
    distinct instructions, depending on how you count.

- en: Most of these instructions are related to arithmetic, and using them all efficiently
    to optimize arithmetic operations requires a great deal of both knowledge, skill,
    and creativity. Therefore, in this chapter, we will discuss number representations
    and their use in numerical algorithms.
