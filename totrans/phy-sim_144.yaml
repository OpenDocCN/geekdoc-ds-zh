- en: In physics-based simulation, the **continuum assumption** enables us to model
    a wide range of materials with rich and diverse behaviors. While **hyperelasticity**
    provides a convenient and elegant model for materials that return to their rest
    shape after deformation, such as rubber or soft tissue, it represents only a small
    portion of the physical phenomena observed in the real world.

- en: Many natural and everyday materials, including **sand**, **snow**, **mud**,
    **metal**, **foam**, and **fracturing solids**, exhibit irreversible deformation,
    dissipation, or flow-like behavior that cannot be captured by purely elastic models.
    These materials require constitutive models that incorporate **plasticity** (permanent
    deformation) and **viscosity** (rate-dependent stress response).

- en: The core difference between **elasticity** and **plasticity** lies in how materials
    store and dissipate energy. Elastic deformation is reversible and energy-conservative;
    plastic deformation is **irreversible**, governed by **yield criteria**, and involves
    **energy dissipation** through internal reconfiguration of the material structure.

- en: MPM is particularly well suited for simulating plastic and viscous materials,
    as it naturally supports large deformations, history-dependent state updates,
    and localized inelastic flow, without suffering from mesh entanglement, element
    inversion, or remeshing-related artifacts common in traditional mesh-based methods.

- en: In the remainder of this lecture, we will introduce how plasticity and viscosity
    are incorporated into MPM simulations. We begin with the [discretization of plastic
    flow](./lec27.1-disc_plastic_flow.html) and the representation of irreversible
    deformation. We then describe how to enforce material-specific yield conditions
    and perform [return mapping](./lec27.2-yield_criterion.html) to constrain deformation
    within admissible limits.
