- en: Having introduced standard strain energies, we now proceed to their differentiation
    with respect to the world space coordinates, x, to simulate realistic elastic
    behaviors. However, it's important to first establish the explicit relationship
    between these coordinates x and the deformation gradient F. This relationship
    heavily depends on specific discretization choices.

- en: Before we explore discretization in depth, we should understand how to compute
    the derivatives of the strain energy function, Ψ, with respect to F. These derivatives
    are fundamentally linked to the concept of stress, a critical element in understanding
    material behavior under deformation.
