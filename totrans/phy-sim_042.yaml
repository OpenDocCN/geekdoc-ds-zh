- en: In simulating contact between solids and obstacles, we primarily focus on enforcing
    non-negativity on the signed distances between solid degrees of freedom (DOFs)
    and obstacles, in conjunction with minimizing the Incremental Potential.

    minimization issue for each time step is transformed into an unconstrained problem.
    This is achieved through the introduction of a barrier potential. This potential
    rises to infinity as distances approach zero, effectively generating large repulsion
    forces that prevent interpenetration.'

    Incremental Potential, we attain a balance of momentum, ensure non-interpenetration,
    and generate contact forces that only push but do not pull. The only exception
    in the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is the complementarity slackness, which
    is not strictly satisfied. The accuracy in satisfying this condition can be controlled
    by adjusting the distance threshold d^, albeit at the expense of computational
    efficiency.'

    addresses many contact scenarios, it cannot alone prevent artificial **tunneling**
    in dynamic simulations. To overcome this limitation, our next lecture will introduce
    the filtered line search scheme, an advanced technique designed to provide more
    guarantees to our simulations.'

    particularly in computational physics and computer graphics, refers to a phenomenon
    where fast-moving objects pass through other objects or barriers without physically
    interacting with them, as if there were a tunnel through the barrier. This typically
    happens in scenarios involving discrete time steps, such as in computer simulations
    of physical systems.'

- en: In a real-world scenario, when two objects collide, there should be a physical
    interaction like a bounce, a stop, or a deformation. However, in a simulation
    with discrete time steps, if an object is moving very fast or the time steps are
    too large, the object's position might be calculated as being on one side of a
    barrier in one step and then on the other side in the next, without ever detecting
    a collision. This "skipping" of the collision step leads to what appears as tunneling
    through the object.
