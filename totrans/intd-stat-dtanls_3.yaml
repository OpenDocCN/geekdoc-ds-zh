- en: Studying the results of the 2020 US presidential election holds profound relevance
    in terms of understanding contemporary American politics, as well as research
    on electoral behavior. Analyzing the voting patterns unveils the interplay of
    demographics, ideology, and socio-economic factors shaping political preferences.
    Such insights not only inform electoral strategies but also deepen our comprehension
    of societal divisions and cleavages. The 2020 election also stands out through
    an effort to overturn the election result by Donald Trump and co-conspirators.
    This has caused turmoil and abet the January 6 United States Capitol attack (e.g.,
    see [https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack](https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack)
    and [https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/doj-charges-trump/](https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/doj-charges-trump/)).

- en: Before the election, a team of researchers from the American National Election
    Study (ANES) conducted a large representative survey (based on a random sample
    of the US population) to study voting intentions. We will work with these data
    in this case study. We are particularly interested in which individuals are more
    likely to support Donald Trump compared to Joe Biden. In doing so, we will present
    data in the form of cross tabulations. We will also take a closer look at the
    topic of correlation analysis by investigating the relationship between average
    education and average Trum support across US states.
