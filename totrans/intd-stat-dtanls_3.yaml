- en: Studying the results of the 2020 US presidential election holds profound relevance
    in terms of understanding contemporary American politics, as well as research
    on electoral behavior. Analyzing the voting patterns unveils the interplay of
    demographics, ideology, and socio-economic factors shaping political preferences.
    Such insights not only inform electoral strategies but also deepen our comprehension
    of societal divisions and cleavages. The 2020 election also stands out through
    an effort to overturn the election result by Donald Trump and co-conspirators.
    This has caused turmoil and abet the January 6 United States Capitol attack (e.g.,
    see [https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack](https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack)
    and [https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/doj-charges-trump/](https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/doj-charges-trump/)).

    Study (ANES) conducted a large representative survey (based on a random sample
    of the US population) to study voting intentions. We will work with these data
    in this case study. We are particularly interested in which individuals are more
    likely to support Donald Trump compared to Joe Biden. In doing so, we will present
    data in the form of cross tabulations. We will also take a closer look at the
    topic of correlation analysis by investigating the relationship between average
    education and average Trum support across US states.

    by 51.3% to 46.9%. The survey results indicate that at the time the survey was
    conducted, 53.3% would have voted for Biden (compared to 42.8% for Trump). While
    the survey correctly predicted Biden as the winner, the result deviated from the
    actual election outcome by about 2 percentage points. Inferring from samples to
    the underlying population is always subject to some uncertainty. We can quantify
    margins of uncertainty, and we will do so in the case study on statistical inference.
    Beyond the role of statistical uncertainty, several further factors (e.g., political
    campaigning or situational circumstances on voting day) might have contributed
    to the outcome of the election result and possibly account for the difference
    between the survey results and the actual vote.

    the variable `trump` the category “won’t vote” was recoded to NA, which means
    declaring to the program to not include these cases in the statistical analysis.
    Note that for some functions in R, it is necessary to explicitly exclude missing
    values (e.g., using the option “na.rm=TRUE”). Other functions do this automatically.
  prefs: []

    if you want to display the frequency of missing values, you have to specify “`exclude=NULL`”.
    The *mean* command, however, does not exclude missing values automatically and
    therefore we have to specify the option “`na.rm=TRUE`” (i.e., “*NA remove* = TRUE”).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the following, we are interested in which groups of people were more likely
    to support Trump in the US presidential election. To do so, we focus on respondents’
    education and age. Education is measured with a few categories. Hence, setting
    up a cross tabulation or cross tab (= a table involving two variables) is appropriate.
    In contrast, age is measured in years and thus comprises many more categories.
    This would make a cross tab involving age rather cumbersome. We could recode age
    into a few age categories and use them in a cross tab or we could compare age
    distributions across voting intentions. Below, we will explore both options.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we are interested in whether or not people’s vote choice differs across
    education groups. If this is the case, we could state that education and voting
    intentions are statistically related or associated with each other. If not, both
    would be independent. Following conventions, the “variable to be explained” (a.k.a.
    outcome or dependent variable) is represented by the rows of the cross tab and
    the “explanatory variable” (a.k.a. causal factor or independent variable) by the
    columns. We calculate column percentages for the interpretation (i.e., the number
    of observations for each cell divided by the total number of observations for
    each column. Hence, adding all proportions per column adds up to 100%). In our
    case, the causal order is quite clear. We have good reason to believe that (if
    anything) `education` determines voting intentions (`trump`) and **not** the other
    way around (i.e., voting intentions would cause higher or lower education). Note
    that in many other cases, the causal order is not as clear and we can freely choose
    which variable goes in the rows and which in the columns.

- en: Scatter plots and correlation are suitable for showing relationships between
    two variables. In the following, we use the average approval of Trump across US
    states in % (`perc_trump`) as the variable to be explained (a.k.a. the outcome
    or dependent variable). State-specific variations in voting patterns are illustrated
    in the following map. As an explanatory variable, we use the proportion of people
    in the state who have a high level of education (Master’s or postgraduate) in
    % (`perc_higheducation`). Both variables originate from individual-level data
    of the ANES study and have been aggregated to the state level (i.e., the means
    per region were stored in a new dataset).

    of association between x and y because its value heavily depends on the scales
    x and y are measured. At the same time, it serves to determine the direction of
    the empirical association. To do so, the classification of observations into above/below
    the mean quadrants is useful again. Observations that are above both means (i.e.,
    upper right corner) have a positive sign and contribute as a product to a “positive”
    covariance or correlation. The same is true for observations in the lower left
    quadrant because here both differences have a negative sign, which again contributes
    as a product to a positive covariance (and thus correlation). In contrast, observations
    in the upper left and lower right quadrants contribute to a negative covariance
    (and thus correlation). If observations are evenly distributed across all quadrants,
    positive and negative products cancel each other out, which would lead to a zero
    covariance (and thus correlation). The step from covariance to correlation is
    that the covariance is *standardized* by the standard deviation of x and y which
    removes the scale units covariance is measured on and transforms the measure to
    range between -1 and +1.

    To quantify the empirical association, we can calculate Cramér’s V. This measure

    It is based on a chi-square test for independence. The chi-square value indicates

    all observations are equally distributed (relative to marginal distribution) across
    the cells of the cross tab. The more the measured observations deviate from the
    theoretical distribution, the higher the chi-square value and subsequently Cramér’s
