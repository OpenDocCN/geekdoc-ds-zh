    we first look at the [Karate Club dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club).

- en: A social network of a karate club was studied by Wayne W. Zachary for a period
    of three years from 1970 to 1972\. The network captures 34 members of a karate
    club, documenting links between pairs of members who interacted outside the club.
    During the study a conflict arose between the administrator “John A” and instructor
    “Mr. Hi” (pseudonyms), which led to the split of the club into two. Half of the
    members formed a new club around Mr. Hi; members from the other part found a new
    instructor or gave up karate. Based on collected data Zachary correctly assigned
    all but one member of the club to the groups they actually joined after the split.

    it (with help from Claude, who really likes the number `42`.). We will say more
    about it later in this chapter. In the meantime, there is a good tutorial [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html).
