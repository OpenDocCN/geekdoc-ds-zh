- en: The Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) method effectively maintains non-interpenetration
    constraints within solid simulations. This method models a constitutive relationship
    that directly correlates contact forces with their respective distances, thus
    converting the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. By using appropriately
    small time steps, the IPC allows for robust and accurate solid simulations free
    from obstacle interpenetration within an optimization-based time integration framework.

    multiple local minima in the Incremental Potential. This condition can lead to
    tunneling issues, where solids might unexpectedly pass through obstacles due to
    overly large search directions. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a filter line
    search strategy supplemented by continuous collision detection (CCD). This approach
    is designed to prevent tunneling by continuously adjusting the trajectory of solids
    in response to potential collisions.

    square falls onto the ground. This example will demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the IPC method along with the filter line search and CCD in managing the dynamics
    of solid bodies and ensuring accurate, interpenetration-free simulations.
