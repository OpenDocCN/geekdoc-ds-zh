- en: In this section, based on our learnings from [Frictional Contact](lec9-friction.html),
    we implement frictional contact for a slope within the optimization time integration
    framework. We start by extending the contact model used for horizontal grounds
    in the [Square Drop](lec8.3-square_drop.html) case study to accommodate slopes
    with arbitrary orientations and locations.

- en: Following this extension, we implement friction for the slope, tested by simulating
    an elastic square dropped onto it. Depending on the friction coefficient μ, the
    square either stops at various points on the slope or continues to slide.
