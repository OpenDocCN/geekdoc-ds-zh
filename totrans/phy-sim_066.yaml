- en: 'As mentioned in the previous lecture, for a solid undergoing only translational
    and/or rotational motions, no elastic potential energy is stored, and thus no
    elasticity force is exerted. This implies that any strain energy density functions
    Ψ(F) have a **rigid null space**, meaning that Ψ(F) should remain 0 if the input
    deformation gradient is any rotation matrix R: Ψ(F)=0∀ F=R. A square matrix F
    is a rotation matrix if and only if: FT=F−1andJ≡det(F)=1. From this definition,
    a straightforward formulation for Ψ(F) emerges, penalizing any deviation of F
    from being a rotation matrix with quadratic terms: Ψ(F)=4μ​∥FTF−I∥F2​+2λ​(J−1)2.(13.1.1)
    Here, μ and λ are the stiffness parameters, with the first term derived from right-multiplying
    F to both sides of FT=F−1. This intuitive formulation closely aligns with how
    many standard strain energy density functions are constructed.'

    model is characterized by the following energy density function: ΨNH​(F)=2μ​(tr(FTF)−d)−μln(J)+2λ​ln2(J).(13.1.2)
    Taking the derivative of ΨNH​(F) with respect to F, we obtain: ∂F∂Ψ​(F)=μ(F−F−T)+λln(J)F−T.
    From this gradient, it is evident that the μ-term achieves a local minimum when
    F−F−T=0 (i.e., FT=F−1), and for the λ-term, the local minimum occurs at J=1.'

    resistance to stretching, and the **Poisson''s ratio** ν, which measures the incompressibility

    for any nonlinear elastic model is rotation invariant. Mathematically, this is
    expressed as: Ψ(F)=Ψ(RF)∀ F∈Rd×d and d×d rotation matrix R.(13.1.3) Intuitively,
    this means that any rotations applied after deformation should not alter the value
    of the strain energy density function.'

    does not include rigid modes in its null space nor does it satisfy Equation [(13.1.3)](#eq:lec13:rot_invariant).
    This is because linear elasticity is specifically designed for **infinitesimal
    strains**, where no significant rotations are involved.

    **small strain tensor**, and we see that Ψlin​(F) is a quadratic function of F.'

    is calibrated to real-world experiments under conditions of small deformations.
    In such circumstances, all standard strain energy density functions must align
    with linear elasticity. The consistency between these models and linear elasticity
    will be concisely demonstrated after we introduce the polar singular value decomposition
    of F in the next section.

    This implies that the same amount of stretch in any direction results in the same
    energy change. Consequently, there are no special directions in which the material

    on the direction. Materials such as cloth, bones, muscles and wood are examples
    of anisotropic materials, exhibiting different mechanical properties in different
