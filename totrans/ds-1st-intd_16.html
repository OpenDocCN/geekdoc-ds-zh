<p>A typical data analysis involves not only writing and executing code, but also writing text and displaying images
that help tell the story of the analysis. In fact, ideally, we would like to <em>interleave</em> these three media,
with the text and images serving as narration for the code and its output.
In this chapter we will show you how to accomplish this using Jupyter notebooks, a common coding platform in
data science. Jupyter notebooks do precisely what we need: they let you combine text, images, and (executable!) code in a single
document. In this chapter, we will focus on the <em>use</em> of Jupyter notebooks to program in R and write
text via a web interface.
These skills are essential to getting your analysis running; think of it like getting dressed in the morning!
Note that we assume that you already have Jupyter set up and ready to use. If that is not the case, please first read
Chapter <a href="setup.html#setup">13</a> to learn how to install and configure Jupyter on your own
computer.</p>

<p>Jupyter <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kluyver2016jupyter">Kluyver et al. 2016</a>)</span> is a web-based interactive development environment for creating, editing,
and executing documents called Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are
documents that contain a mix of computer code (and its output) and formattable
text. Given that they combine these two analysis artifacts in a single
document—code is not separate from the output or written report—notebooks are
one of the leading tools to create reproducible data analyses. Reproducible data
analysis is one where you can reliably and easily re-create the same results when
analyzing the same data. Although this sounds like something that should always
be true of any data analysis, in reality, this is not often the case; one needs
to make a conscious effort to perform data analysis in a reproducible manner.
An example of what a Jupyter notebook looks like is shown in

<p>One of the easiest ways to start working with Jupyter is to use a
web-based platform called JupyterHub. JupyterHubs often have Jupyter, R, a number of R
packages, and collaboration tools installed, configured and ready to use.
JupyterHubs are usually created and provisioned by organizations,
and require authentication to gain access. For example, if you are reading
this book as part of a course, your instructor may have a JupyterHub
already set up for you to use! <!--- Insert link to public JupyterHub here if we can get
access/permission (either 2i2c collaboration, or

own computer; see Chapter <a href="setup.html#setup">13</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>The sections of a Jupyter notebook that contain code are referred to as code cells.
A code cell that has not yet been
executed has no number inside the square brackets to the left of the cell
(Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:code-cell-not-run">11.2</a>). Running a code cell will execute all of
the code it contains, and the output (if any exists) will be displayed directly
underneath the code that generated it. Outputs may include printed text or
numbers, data frames and data visualizations. Cells that have been executed
also have a number inside the square brackets to the left of the cell.
This number indicates the order in which the cells were run
(Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:code-cell-run">11.3</a>).</p>

<p>Code cells can be run independently or as part of executing the entire notebook
using one of the “<strong>Run all</strong>” commands found in the <strong>Run</strong> or <strong>Kernel</strong> menus
in Jupyter. Running a single code cell independently is a workflow typically
used when editing or writing your own R code. Executing an entire notebook is a
workflow typically used to ensure that your analysis runs in its entirety before
sharing it with others, and when using a notebook as part of an automated
process.</p>
<p>To run a code cell independently, the cell needs to first be activated. This
is done by clicking on it with the cursor. Jupyter will indicate a cell has been
activated by highlighting it with a blue rectangle to its left. After the cell
has been activated (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:activate-and-run-button">11.4</a>), the cell can be run
by either pressing the <strong>Run</strong> (▶).
button in the toolbar, or by using the keyboard shortcut <code>Shift + Enter</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>To execute all of the code cells in an entire notebook, you have three options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Select <strong>Run</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Run All Cells</strong> from the menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Kernel</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Restart Kernel and Run All Cells…</strong> from the menu (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:restart-kernel-run-all">11.5</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the (⏭) button in the tool bar.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All of these commands result in all of the code cells in a notebook being run.
However, there is a slight difference between them. In particular, only
options 2 and 3 above will restart the R session before running all of the
cells; option 1 will not restart the session. Restarting the R session means
that all previous objects that were created from running cells before this
command was run will be deleted. In other words, restarting the session and
then running all cells (options 2 or 3) emulates how your notebook code would
run if you completely restarted Jupyter before executing your entire notebook.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.4.2</span> The Kernel<a href="jupyter.html#the-kernel" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>The kernel is a program that executes the code inside your notebook and
outputs the results. Kernels for many different programming languages have
been created for Jupyter, which means that Jupyter can interpret and execute
the code of many different programming languages. To run R code, your notebook
will need an R kernel. In the top right of your window, you can see a circle
that indicates the status of your kernel. If the circle is empty (◯)
the kernel is idle and ready to execute code. If the circle is filled in (⬤)
the kernel is busy running some code.</p>
<p>You may run into problems where your kernel is stuck for an excessive amount
of time, your notebook is very slow and unresponsive, or your kernel loses its
connection. If this happens, try the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>At the top of your screen, click <strong>Kernel</strong>, then <strong>Interrupt Kernel</strong>.</li>
<li>If that doesn’t help, click <strong>Kernel</strong>, then <strong>Restart Kernel…</strong> If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.</li>
<li>If that still doesn’t help, restart Jupyter. First, save your work by clicking <strong>File</strong> at the top left of your screen, then <strong>Save Notebook</strong>. Next, if you are accessing Jupyter using a JupyterHub server, from the <strong>File</strong> menu click <strong>Hub Control Panel</strong>. Choose <strong>Stop My Server</strong> to shut it down, then the <strong>My Server</strong> button to start it back up. If you are running Jupyter on your own computer, from the <strong>File</strong> menu click <strong>Shut Down</strong>, then start Jupyter again. Finally, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.</li>

<p>Text cells inside a Jupyter notebook are called Markdown cells. Markdown cells
are rich formatted text cells, which means you can <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em>
text, create subject headers, create bullet and numbered lists, and more. These cells are
given the name “Markdown” because they use <em>Markdown language</em> to specify the rich text formatting.
You do not need to learn Markdown to write text in the Markdown cells in
Jupyter; plain text will work just fine. However, you might want to learn a bit
about Markdown eventually to enable you to create nicely formatted analyses.
See the additional resources at the end of this chapter to find out
where you can start learning Markdown.</p>

<p>As you might know (or at least imagine) by now, Jupyter notebooks are great for
interactively editing, writing and running R code; this is what they were
designed for! Consequently, Jupyter notebooks are flexible in regards to code
cell execution order. This flexibility means that code cells can be run in any
arbitrary order using the <strong>Run</strong> (▶) button. But this flexibility has a downside:
it can lead to Jupyter notebooks whose code cannot be executed in a linear
order (from top to bottom of the notebook). A nonlinear notebook is problematic
because a linear order is the conventional way code documents are run, and
others will have this expectation when running your notebook. Finally, if the
code is used in some automated process, it will need to run in a linear order,
from top to bottom of the notebook. </p>
<p>The most common way to inadvertently create a nonlinear notebook is to rely solely
on using the ▶ button to execute cells. For example,
suppose you write some R code that creates an R object, say a variable named
<code>y</code>. When you execute that cell and create <code>y</code>, it will continue
to exist until it is deliberately deleted with R code, or when the Jupyter
notebook R session (<em>i.e.</em>, kernel) is stopped or restarted. It can also be
referenced in another distinct code cell (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:out-of-order-1">11.10</a>).
Together, this means that you could then write a code cell further above in the
notebook that references <code>y</code> and execute it without error in the current session
(Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:out-of-order-2">11.11</a>). This could also be done successfully in
future sessions if, and only if, you run the cells in the same unconventional
order. However, it is difficult to remember this unconventional order, and it
is not the order that others would expect your code to be executed in. Thus, in
the future, this would lead
to errors when the notebook is run in the conventional
linear order (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:out-of-order-3">11.12</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>You can also accidentally create a nonfunctioning notebook by
creating an object in a cell that later gets deleted. In such a
scenario, that object only exists for that one particular R session and will
not exist once the notebook is restarted and run again. If that
object was referenced in another cell in that notebook, an error
would occur when the notebook was run again in a new session.</p>
<p>These events may not negatively affect the current R session when
the code is being written; but as you might now see, they will likely lead to
errors when that notebook is run in a future session. Regularly executing
the entire notebook in a fresh R session will help guard
against this. If you restart your session and new errors seem to pop up when
you run all of your cells in linear order, you can at least be aware that there
is an issue. Knowing this sooner rather than later will allow you to
fix the issue and ensure your notebook can be run linearly from start to finish.</p>
<p>We recommend as a best practice to run the entire notebook in a fresh R session
at least 2–3 times within any period of work. Note that,
critically, you <em>must do this in a fresh R session</em> by restarting your kernel.
We recommend using either the <strong>Kernel</strong> &gt;&gt;
<strong>Restart Kernel and Run All Cells…</strong> command from the menu or the ⏭
button in the toolbar. Note that the <strong>Run</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Run All Cells</strong>
menu item will not restart the kernel, and so it is not sufficient
to guard against these errors.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.7.2</span> Best practices for including R packages in notebooks<a href="jupyter.html#best-practices-for-including-r-packages-in-notebooks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>Most data analyses these days depend on functions from external R packages that
are not built into R. One example is the <code>tidyverse</code> metapackage that we
heavily rely on in this book. This package provides us access to functions like
<code>read_csv</code> for reading data, <code>select</code> for subsetting columns, and <code>ggplot</code> for
creating high-quality graphics.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in the book, external R packages need to be loaded before
the functions they contain can be used. Our recommended way to do this is via
<code>library(package_name)</code>. But where should this line of code be written in a
Jupyter notebook? One idea could be to load the library right before the
function is used in the notebook. However, although this technically works, this
causes hidden, or at least non-obvious, R package dependencies when others view
or try to run the notebook. These hidden dependencies can lead to errors when
the notebook is executed on another computer if the needed R packages are not
installed. Additionally, if the data analysis code takes a long time to run,
uncovering the hidden dependencies that need to be installed so that the
analysis can run without error can take a great deal of time to uncover.</p>
<p>Therefore, we recommend you load all R packages in a code cell near the top of
the Jupyter notebook. Loading all your packages at the start ensures that all
packages are loaded before their functions are called, assuming the notebook is
run in a linear order from top to bottom as recommended above. It also makes it
easy for others viewing or running the notebook to see what external R packages
are used in the analysis, and hence, what packages they should install on
their computer to run the analysis successfully.</p>

<p>It is essential to preview data files before you try to read them into R to see
whether or not there are column names, what the delimiters are, and if there are
lines you need to skip. In Jupyter, you preview data files stored as plain text
files (e.g., comma- and tab-separated files) in their plain text format (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:open-data-w-editor-2">11.14</a>) by
right-clicking on the file’s name in the Jupyter file explorer, selecting
<strong>Open with</strong>, and then selecting <strong>Editor</strong> (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:open-data-w-editor-1">11.13</a>).
Suppose you do not specify to open
the data file with an editor. In that case, Jupyter will render a nice table
for you, and you will not be able to see the column delimiters, and therefore
you will not know which function to use, nor which arguments to use and values
to specify for them.</p>

<p>In Jupyter, viewing, editing and running R code is done in the Jupyter notebook
file format with file extension <code>.ipynb</code>. This file format is not easy to open and
view outside of Jupyter. Thus, to share your analysis with people who do not
commonly use Jupyter, it is recommended that you export your executed analysis
as a more common file type, such as an <code>.html</code> file, or a <code>.pdf</code>. We recommend
exporting the Jupyter notebook after executing the analysis so that you can
also share the outputs of your code. Note, however, that your audience will not be
able to <em>run</em> your analysis using a <code>.html</code> or <code>.pdf</code> file. If you want your audience
to be able to reproduce the analysis, you must provide them with the <code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook file.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.9.1</span> Exporting to HTML<a href="jupyter.html#exporting-to-html" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>Exporting to <code>.html</code> will result in a shareable file that anyone can open
using a web browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or Edge). The <code>.html</code>
output will produce a document that is visually similar to what the Jupyter notebook
looked like inside Jupyter. One point of caution here is that if there are
images in your Jupyter notebook, you will need to share the image files and the
<code>.html</code> file to see them.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.9.2</span> Exporting to PDF<a href="jupyter.html#exporting-to-pdf" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>Exporting to <code>.pdf</code> will result in a shareable file that anyone can open
using many programs, including Adobe Acrobat, Preview, web browsers and many
more. The benefit of exporting to PDF is that it is a standalone document,
even if the Jupyter notebook included references to image files.
Unfortunately, the default settings will result in a document
that visually looks quite different from what the Jupyter notebook looked
like. The font, page margins, and other details will appear different in the <code>.pdf</code> output.</p>

<p>At some point, you will want to create a new, fresh Jupyter notebook for your
own project instead of viewing, running or editing a notebook that was started
by someone else. To do this, navigate to the <strong>Launcher</strong> tab, and click on
the R icon under the <strong>Notebook</strong> heading. If no <strong>Launcher</strong> tab is visible,
you can get a new one via clicking the <strong>+</strong> button at the top of the Jupyter
file explorer (Figure <a href="jupyter.html#fig:launcher">11.15</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>Once you have created a new Jupyter notebook, be sure to give it a descriptive
name, as the default file name is <code>Untitled.ipynb</code>. You can rename files by
first right-clicking on the file name of the notebook you just created, and
then clicking <strong>Rename</strong>. This will make
the file name editable. Use your keyboard to
change the name. Pressing <code>Enter</code> or clicking anywhere else in the Jupyter
interface will save the changed file name.</p>
<p>We recommend not using white space or non-standard characters in file names.
Doing so will not prevent you from using that file in Jupyter. However, these
sorts of things become troublesome as you start to do more advanced data
science projects that involve repetition and automation. We recommend naming
files using lower case characters and separating words by a dash (<code>-</code>) or an
underscore (<code>_</code>).</p>

is a good next place to look for more information about working in Jupyter
notebooks. This documentation goes into significantly more detail about all of
the topics we covered in this chapter, and covers more advanced topics as well.</li>
