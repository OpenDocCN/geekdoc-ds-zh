    4 interactive proof assistant. It assumes that you know some mathematics, but
    it does not require much. Although we will cover examples ranging from number
    theory to measure theory and analysis, we will focus on elementary aspects of
    those fields, in the hopes that if they are not familiar to you, you can pick
    them up as you go. We also don’t presuppose any background with formal methods.
    Formalization can be seen as a kind of computer programming: we will write mathematical
    definitions, theorems, and proofs in a regimented language, like a programming
    language, that Lean can understand. In return, Lean provides feedback and information,
    interprets expressions and guarantees that they are well-formed, and ultimately
    certifies the correctness of our proofs.'

    `k` and the assumption that `n = 2 * k`. The second line, `use m * k`, declares
    that we are going to show that `m * n` is even by showing `m * n = 2 * (m * k)`.
    The next line uses the `rw` tactic to replace `n` by `2 * k` in the goal (`rw`

    4 interactive proof assistant. It assumes that you know some mathematics, but
    it does not require much. Although we will cover examples ranging from number
    theory to measure theory and analysis, we will focus on elementary aspects of
    those fields, in the hopes that if they are not familiar to you, you can pick
    them up as you go. We also don’t presuppose any background with formal methods.
    Formalization can be seen as a kind of computer programming: we will write mathematical
    definitions, theorems, and proofs in a regimented language, like a programming
    language, that Lean can understand. In return, Lean provides feedback and information,
    interprets expressions and guarantees that they are well-formed, and ultimately
    certifies the correctness of our proofs.'

    which provides a more thorough introduction to the underlying logical framework
    and core syntax of Lean. *Theorem Proving in Lean* is for people who prefer to
    read a user manual cover to cover before using a new dishwasher. If you are the
    kind of person who prefers to hit the *start* button and figure out how to activate
    the potscrubber feature later, it makes more sense to start here and refer back
    to *Theorem Proving in Lean* as necessary.

    in Lean* is that here we place a much greater emphasis on the use of *tactics*.
    Given that we are trying to build complex expressions, Lean offers two ways of
    going about it: we can write down the expressions themselves (that is, suitable
    text descriptions thereof), or we can provide Lean with *instructions* as to how
    to construct them. For example, the following expression represents a proof of
    the fact that if `n` is even then so is `m * n`:'

- en: As you enter each line of such a proof in VS Code, Lean displays the *proof
    state* in a separate window, telling you what facts you have already established
    and what tasks remain to prove your theorem. You can replay the proof by stepping
    through the lines, since Lean will continue to show you the state of the proof
    at the point where the cursor is. In this example, you will then see that the
    first line of the proof introduces `m` and `n` (we could have renamed them at
    that point, if we wanted to), and also decomposes the hypothesis `Even n` to a
    `k` and the assumption that `n = 2 * k`. The second line, `use m * k`, declares
    that we are going to show that `m * n` is even by showing `m * n = 2 * (m * k)`.
    The next line uses the `rw` tactic to replace `n` by `2 * k` in the goal (`rw`
    stands for “rewrite”), and the `ring` tactic solves the resulting goal `m * (2
    * k) = 2 * (m * k)`.

    powerful. For that reason, tactic proofs are often easier and quicker to write
    than proof terms. There isn’t a sharp distinction between the two: tactic proofs
    can be inserted in proof terms, as we did with the phrase `by rw [hk, mul_add]`
    in the example above. We will also see that, conversely, it is often useful to
    insert a short proof term in the middle of a tactic proof. That said, in this
    book, our emphasis will be on the use of tactics.'

    provide substantial automation, and justify longer calculations and bigger inferential
    steps. For example, we can invoke Lean’s simplifier with specific rules for simplifying
    statements about parity to prove our theorem automatically.

    in Lean* depends only on core Lean and its built-in tactics, whereas *Mathematics
    in Lean* is built on top of Lean’s powerful and ever-growing library, *Mathlib*.
    As a result, we can show you how to use some of the mathematical objects and theorems
    in the library, and some of the very useful tactics. This book is not meant to
    be used as an complete overview of the library; the [community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)
    web pages contain extensive documentation. Rather, our goal is to introduce you
    to the style of thinking that underlies that formalization, and point out basic
    entry points so that you are comfortable browsing the library and finding things
    on your own.
