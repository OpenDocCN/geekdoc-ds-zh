- en: The **elastic potential energy** Pe​ is an integration of the **strain energy
    density function** Ψ(F) at every local point in the solid domain. From the **rigid
    null space**, we derived an intuitive formulation of the strain energy density
    function, similar in structure to standard models like **Neo-Hookean**. Nonlinear
    elastic models are also **rotation invariant**, meaning any rotations applied
    after the deformation F do not change Ψ.

- en: '**Linear elasticity** features a quadratic energy density function and is specifically
    designed for **infinitesimal strains** ϵ, lacking rigid modes in its null space.
    Yet, with the corresponding **Lame Parameters** μ and λ, it can accurately capture
    behaviors of small deformations observed in the real world. Standard elasticity
    models are required to be **consistent with linear elasticity** under small deformations.'

- en: This lecture focused on **isotropic elasticity**, where no special directions
    exist that make the material harder or easier to deform. Performing **Polar SVD**
    on F=UΣV allows us to rewrite Ψ(F) of isotropic models using only **principal
    stretches** σi​=Σii​.

- en: Using the **closest rotation** Rn=Un(Vn)T to Fn in the last time step, we constructed
    a **corotated linear elasticity** to make linear elasticity rotation-aware while
    maintaining its simplicity. Simplifying further by retaining only the μ-term enhances
    efficiency for visual computing.

- en: Similar to how non-interpenetrations are enforced in IPC, the energy density
    function of Neo-Hookean acts as a barrier function, ensuring non-inversion (det(F)>0).
    All other elasticity models introduced in this lecture are **invertible**, and
    they do not guarantee non-inversion.

    F.
