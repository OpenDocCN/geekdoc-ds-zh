    a tour of our two different **integrated development environments environments**
    (IDEs) RStudio and Spyder.

    on my eyes. If you are opening RStudio for the first time, you probably see a
    lot more white. You can play around with the theme, if you wish, after going to
    `Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance`.

- en: The **console**, which is located by default on the lower left panel, is the
    place that all of your code gets run. For short one-liners, you can type code
    directly into the console. Try typing the following code in there. Here we are
    making use of the `print()` function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In R, functions are “first-class objects,” which means can refer to the name
    of a function without asking it to do anything. However, when we *do* want to
    use it, we put parentheses after the name. This is called **calling** the function
    or **invoking** the function. If a function call takes any **arguments** (aka
    inputs), then the programmer supplies them between the two parentheses. A function
    may **return** values to be subsequently used, or it may just produce a “side-effect”
    such as printing some text, displaying a chart, or read/writing information to
    an external data source.

- en: During the semester, we will write more complicated code. Complicated code is
    usually written incrementally and stored in a text file called a **script**. Click
    `File -> New File -> R Script` to create a new script. It should appear at the
    top left of the RStudio window (see Figure [1.1](/intro#fig:rstudio) ) . After
    that, copy and paste the following code into your script window.

- en: This script will run five print statements, and then create a variable called
    `myName`. The print statements are of no use to the computer and will not affect
    how the program runs. They just display messages to the human running the code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The variable created on the last line is more important because it is used by
    the computer, and so it can affect how the program runs. The operator `<-` is
    the [**assignment operator**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html).
    It takes the character constant `"Taylor"`, which is on the right, and stores
    it under the name `myName`. If we added lines to this program, we could refer
    to the variable `myName` in subsequent calculations.

    Personally, I saved it to my desktop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After we have a saved script, we can run it by sending all the lines of code
    over to the console. One way to do that is by clicking the `Source` button at
    the top right of the script window (see Figure [1.1](/intro#fig:rstudio) ). Another
    way is that we can use R’s `source()` function[¹](#fn1). We can run the following
    code in the console.

- en: The first line changes the [working directory](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/getwd.html)
    to `Desktop/`. The **working directory** is the first place your program looks
    for files. You, dear reader, should change this line by replacing `Desktop/` to
    whichever folder you chose to save `awesomeScript.R` in. If you would like to
    find out what your working directory is currently set to, you can use `getwd()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every computer has a different folder/directory structure–that is why it is
    highly recommended you refer to file locations as seldom as possible in your scripts.
    This makes your code more *portable.* When you send your file to someone else
    (e.g. your instructor or your boss), she will have to remove or change every mention
    of any directory. This is because those directories (probably) won’t exist on
    her machine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second line calls `source()`. This function finds the script file and executes
    all the commands found in that file sequentially.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deleting all saved variables, and then `source()`ing your script can be a very
    good debugging strategy. You can remove all saved variables by running `rm(list=ls())`.
    Don’t worry–the variables will come back as soon as you `source()` your entire
    script again!

    our program, sequentially, from start to finish[³](#fn3).

    We will talk more about `import`ing modules in section [10.4](/using-third-party-code#loading-packages-in-python).
    Suffice it to say that we imported the `os` module to make the `chdir()` function
    available to us.

    function and all of its arguments. So what do programmers do when they get stuck?
    The primary way is to find and read the documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Getting help in R is easy. If you want to know more about a function, type into
    the console the name of the function with a leading question mark. For example,
    `?print` or `?setwd`. You can also use `help()` and `help.search()` to find out
    more about functions (e.g. `help(print)`). Sometimes you will need to put quotation
    marks around the name of the function (e.g. `?":"`).

    If you are using RStudio, you have some extra benefits. Everything will look very
    pretty, and you can search through the text by typing phrases into the search
    bar in the “Help” window.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Python, the question mark comes *after* the name of the function[⁴](#fn4)
    (e.g. `print?`), and you can use `help(print)` just as in R.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Spyder, if you want the documentation to appear in the Help window (it looks
    prettier), then you can type the name of the function, and then `Ctrl-i` (`Cmd-i`
    on a mac keyboard).

- en: 1.3.2 Understanding File Paths
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: File paths look different on different operating systems. Mac and Linux machines
    tend to have forward slashes (i.e. `/`), while Windows machines tend to use backslashes
    (i.e. `\`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on what kind of operating system is running your code, you will need
    to change the file paths. It is important for everyone writing R and Python code
    to understand how things work on both types of machines–just because you’re writing
    code on a Windows machine doesn’t mean that it won’t be run on a Mac, or vice
    versa.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The directory repeatedly mentioned in the code above was `/home/taylor/Desktop`.
    This is a directory on my machine which is running Ubuntu Linux. The leading forward
    slash is the *root directory*. Inside that is the directory `home/`, and inside
    that is `taylor/`, and inside that is `Desktop/`. If you are running MacOS, these
    file paths will look very similar. The folder `home/` will most likely be replaced
    with `Users/`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On Windows, things are a bit different. For one, a full path starts with a drive
    (e.g. `C:`). Second, there are backslashes (not forward slashes) to separate directory
    names (e.g `C:\Users\taylor\Desktop`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, backslashes are a special character in both R and Python (read
    section [3.9](/r-vectors-versus-numpy-arrays-and-pandas-series#an-introduction-to-regular-expressions)
    to find out more about this). Whenever you type a `\`, it will change the meaning
    of whatever comes after it. In other words, `\` is known as an **escape character**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both R and Python, the backslash character is used to start an “escape” sequence.
    You can see some examples in R by clicking [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Quotes.html),
    and some examples in Python by clicking [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html).
    In Python it may also be used to [allow long lines of code to take up more than
    one line in a text file.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#explicit-line-joining)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The recommended way of handling this is to just use forward slashes instead.
    For example, if you are running Windows, `C:/Users/taylor/Desktop/myScript.R`
    will work in R, and `C:/Users/taylor/Desktop/myScript.py` will work in Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may also use “raw string constants” (e.g. `r'C:\Users\taylor\my_file.txt'`
    ). “Raw” means that `\` will be treated as a literal character instead of an escape
    character. Alternatively, you can “escape” the backslashes by replacing each single
    backslash with a double backslash. Please read section [3.9](/r-vectors-versus-numpy-arrays-and-pandas-series#an-introduction-to-regular-expressions)
    for more details about these choices.
