- en: 'In the continuous setting, forces are categorized into body forces (also known
    as external forces, such as gravity) and surface forces (or internal forces, typically
    stress-based, like those arising from elasticity). We define stress-based forces
    through a traction field, whose existence is assumed. The traction, or force per
    unit area, is represented by the field T(⋅,N,t):Ω0→Rd and is defined by the equation:
    forceS​(Bϵ0​)=∫∂Bϵ0​​T(X,N(X))ds(X), where N represents the outward-pointing normal
    direction in the material space. Here, forceS​(Bϵ0​) denotes the net force exerted
    from the material outside ∂Bϵ0​ on the material inside Bϵ0​ through their interface.
    The function T(X,N,t) quantifies the force per unit area (d=3) or length (d=2)
    that material on the N+ side exerts at point X on material on the N− side.'

    of momentum is the primary governing equation we use to simulate solids. As discussed
    previously, both the acceleration, denoted by ∂t∂V​(X,t), and the internal force,
    expressed as ∇X⋅P(X,t), can be described using world space coordinates x. With
    all other relevant quantities established, we incrementally solve for x to get
    dynamic motions step by step.'
