    we use to keep these issues front of mind and understand the implications. But

    who profits from the data that were collected, and whose power it reflects.

    it brings. We then turn to censuses, in which we typically try to obtain data
    about an entire population. We also discuss other government official statistics,
    and long-standing surveys. We describe datasets of this type as “farmed data”.
    Farmed datasets are typically well put together, thoroughly documented, and the
    work of collecting, preparing, and cleaning these datasets is mostly done for
    us. They are also, usually, conducted on a known release cycle. For instance,
    many countries release unemployment and inflation datasets monthly, GDP quarterly,
    and a census every five to ten years.

    have developed considerable sophistication for thinking about samples, and dealt
    with many controversies ([Brewer 2013](99-references.html#ref-brewer2013three)).

    context especially constructed by the state ([Stoler 2002](99-references.html#ref-Stoler2002)).
    Thinking clearly about who is included in the dataset, and who is systematically
    excluded, is critical. Understanding, capturing, classifying, and naming data

    Sex is based on biological attributes and is assigned at birth, while gender is

    between gender, rather than sex, and some outcome. But the move toward a nuanced
    concept of gender in official statistics has only happened recently. Surveys that
    insist on a binary gender variable that is the same as sex, will not reflect those
    respondents who do not identify as such. Kennedy et al. ([2022](99-references.html#ref-kennedy2020using))
    provide a variety of aspects to consider when deciding what to do with gender
    responses, including: ethics, accuracy, practicality, and flexibility. But there

    Scott ([1998](99-references.html#ref-scott1998seeing)) positions much of this
    as an outcome of the state, for its own purposes, wanting to make society legible
    and considers this a defining feature of modern states. For instance, Scott ([1998](99-references.html#ref-scott1998seeing))
    sees the use of surnames as arising because of the state’s desire for legible
    lists to use for taxation, property ownership, conscription, and censuses. The
    state’s desire for legibility also required imposing consistency on measurement.
    The modern form of metrology, which is “the study of how measurements are made,
    and how data are compared” ([Plant and Hanisch 2020](99-references.html#ref-Plant2020Reproducibility)),
    began in the French Revolution when various measurements were standardized. This
    later further developed as part of Napoleonic state building ([Scott 1998, 30](99-references.html#ref-scott1998seeing)).
    Prévost and Beaud ([2015, 154](99-references.html#ref-prevost2015statistics))
    describe the essence of the change as one where knowledge went from being “singular,
    local, idiosyncratic\(\dots\) and often couched in literary form” to generalized,
    standardized, and numeric. That all said, it would be difficult to collect data
    without categorizable, measurable scales. A further concern is reification, where
    we forget that these measures must be constructed.

    define measurement as the “process of experimentally obtaining one or more quantity
    values that can reasonably be attributed to a quantity”, where a quantity is a
    “number and reference together”. It implies “comparison of quantities, including
    counting of entities”, and “presupposes a description of the quantity commensurate
    with the intended use of a measurement result, a measurement procedure, and a
    calibrated measuring system\(\dots\)”. This definition of measurement makes clear
    that we have a variety of concerns including instrumentation and units, and that
    we are interested in measurements that are valid and reliable.

- en: Instrumentation refers to what we use to conduct the measurement. Thorough consideration
    of instrumentation is important because it determines what we can measure. For
    instance, Morange ([2016, 63](99-references.html#ref-morange)) describes how the
    invention of microscopes in the sixteenth century led to the observation of capillaries
    by Marcello Malpighi in 1661, cells by Robert Hooke in 1665, and bacteria by Antonie
    van Leeuwenhoek in 1677 ([Lane 2015](99-references.html#ref-lane2015unseen)).
    And consider the measurement of time. Again we see the interaction between instrumentation
    and measurement. With a sundial it was difficult to be much more specific about
    elapsed time than an hour or so. But the gradual development of more accurate
    instruments of timekeeping would eventually enable some sports to differentiate
    competitors to the thousandth of the second, and through GPS, allow navigation
    that is accurate to within meters.
  prefs: []

- en: '*Oh, you think we have good data on that!* *Knowing the time is a critical
    measurement. For instance, Formula 1 times laps to the thousandth of a second.
    And Michael Phelps, an American swimmer, won a gold medal at the Beijing Olympics
    by only one-hundredth of a second. Timing allows us to distinguish between outcomes
    even when the event does not happen concurrently. For instance, think back to
    the discussion of swimmers by Chambliss ([1989](99-references.html#ref-chambliss1989mundanity))
    and how this would be impossible without knowing how long each event took each
    swimmer. Timing is also critical in finance where we need market participants
    to agree on whether an asset is available for sale. But the answer to “What time
    is it?” can be difficult to answer. The time, according to some individual, can
    be set to different sources, and so will differ depending on who you ask. Since
    the 1970s the definitive answer has been to use atomic time. A cesium second is
    defined by “9192 631 770 cycles of the hyperfine transition frequency in the ground
    state of cesium 133” ([Levine, Tavella, and Milton 2022, 4](99-references.html#ref-Levine2023)).
    But the problem of clock synchronization—how to have all the non-atomic clocks
    match atomic time and each other—remains. Hopper ([2022](99-references.html#ref-hopper2022))
    provides an overview of how the Network Time Protocol (NTP) of Mills ([1991](99-references.html#ref-mills1991internet))
    enables clock synchronization and some of the difficulties that exist for computer
    networks to discover atomic time. Another measure of time is astronomical time,
    which is based on the rotation of the Earth. But because the Earth spins inconsistently
    and other issues, adjustments have been made to ensure atomic and astronomical
    time match. This has resulted in the inclusions of positive leap seconds, and
    the possibility of a negative leap second, which have created problems ([Levine,
    Tavella, and Milton 2022](99-references.html#ref-Levine2023)). As a result, at
    some point in the future astronomical and atomic time will be allowed to diverge
    ([Gibney 2022](99-references.html#ref-Gibney2022); [Mitchell 2022b](99-references.html#ref-mitchell2022again)).*  *A
    common instrument of measurement is a survey, and we discuss these further in
    [Chapter 8](08-hunt.html). Another commonly-used instrument is sensors. For instance,
    climate scientists may be interested in temperature, humidity, or pressure. Much
    analysis of animal movement, such as Leos-Barajas et al. ([2016](99-references.html#ref-LeosBarajas2016)),
    uses accelerometers. Sensors placed on satellites may be particularly concerned
    with images, and such data are available from the Landsat Program. Physicists
    are very concerned with measurement, and can be constrained not only by their
    instrumentation, but also storage capacity. For instance, the ATLAS detector at
    CERN is focused on the collision of particles, but not all of the measurements
    can be saved because that would result in 80TB per second ([Colombo et al. 2016](99-references.html#ref-Colombo2016))!
    And in the case of A/B testing, which we discuss in [Chapter 8](08-hunt.html),
    extensive use is made of cookies, beacons, system settings, and behavioral patterns.
    Another aspect of instrumentation is delivery. For instance, if using surveys,
    then should they be mailed or online? Should they be filled out by the respondent
    or by an enumerator?'

- en: The definition of measurement, provided by metrology, makes it clear that the
    second fundamental concern is a reference, which we refer to as units. The choice
    of units is related to both the research question of interest and available instrumentation.
    For instance, in the Tutorial in [Chapter 1](01-introduction.html) we were concerned
    with measuring the growth of plants. This would not be well served by using kilometers
    or miles as a unit. If we were using a ruler, then we may be able to measure millimeters,
    but with calipers, we might be able to consider tens of micrometers.

    Recall, from [Chapter 4](04-writing_research.html), that an estimand is the actual
    effect, such as the (unknowable) actual effect of smoking on life expectancy.
    It can be useful to think about estimands as what is actually of interest. This
    means that we need to ensure that we are measuring relevant aspects of an individual.
    For instance, the number of cigarettes that they smoked, and the number of years
    they lived, rather than, say, their opinion about smoking.

    But for other aspects that we may wish to measure it is less clear and so the
    validity of the measurement becomes critical. At one point in the fourteenth century
    attempts were made to measure grace and virtue ([Crosby 1997, 14](99-references.html#ref-crosby1997measure))!
    More recently, we try to measure intelligence or even the quality of a university.
    That is not to say there are not people with more or less grace, virtue, and intelligence
    than others, and there are certainly better and worse universities. But the measurement

    on aspects such as class size, number of faculty with a PhD, and number of full-time
    faculty. But an issue with such constructed measures, especially in social settings,
    is that it changes the incentives of those being measured. For instance, Columbia
    University increased from 18th in 1988 to 2nd in 2022\. But Michael Thaddeus,
    Professor of Mathematics, Columbia University, showed how there was a difference,
    in Columbia’s favor, between what Columbia reported to *U.S. News and World Report*

    review the measurement of depression and find many concerns including a lack of
    validity and reliability. This is not to say that we should not try to measure
    such things, but we should ensure transparency about measurement decisions. For
    instance, Flake and Fried ([2020](99-references.html#ref-Flake2020)) recommend
    answering various clarifying questions whenever measurements have to be constructed.
    These include questioning the underlying construct of interest, the decision process
    that led to the measure, what alternatives were considered, the quantification
    process, and the scale. These questions are especially important when the measure
    is being constructed for a particular purpose, rather than being adopted from
    elsewhere. This is because of the concern that the measure will be constructed
    in a way that provides a pre-ordained outcome.

- en: Reliability draws on the part of the definition of measurement that reads “process
    of experimentally obtaining\(\dots\)”. It implies some degree of consistency and
    means that multiple measurements of one particular aspect, at one particular time,
    should be essentially the same. If two enumerators count the number of shops on
    a street, then we would hope that their counts are the same. And if they were
    different then we would hope we could understand the reason for the difference.
    For instance, perhaps one enumerator misunderstood the instructions and incorrectly
    counted only shops that were open. To consider another example, demographers are
    often concerned with the migration of people between countries, and economists
    are often concerned with international trade. It is concerning the number of times
    that the in-migration or imports data of Country A from Country B do not match
    the out-migration or exports data of Country B to Country A.

    plane to announce the altitude to their passengers. But the notion and measurement
    of altitude is deceptively complicated, and underscores the fact that measurement
    occurs within a broader context ([Vanhoenacker 2015](99-references.html#ref-skyfaring)).
    For instance, if we are interested in how many meters there are between the plane
    and the ground, then should we measure the difference between the ground and where
    the pilot is sitting, which would be most relevant for the announcement, or to
    the bottom of the wheels, which would be most relevant for landing? What happens
    if we go over a mountain? Even if the plane has not descended, such a measure—the
    number of meters between the plane and the ground—would claim a reduction in altitude
    and make it hard to vertically separate multiple planes. We may be interested
    in a comparison to sea level. But sea level changes because of the tide, and is
    different at different locations. As such, a common measure of altitude is flight
    level, which is determined by the amount of air pressure. And because air pressure
    is affected by weather, season, and location, the one flight level may be associated
    with very different numbers of meters to the ground over the course of a flight.
    The measures of altitude used by planes serve their purpose of enabling relatively
    safe air travel.*  *### 6.2.2 Measurement error'

    value. Sometimes it is possible to verify certain responses. If the difference
    is consistent between the responses that we can verify and those that we cannot,

    Sakshaug, Yan, and Tourangeau ([2010](99-references.html#ref-Sakshaug2010)) considered
    a survey of university alumni and compared replies about a respondent’s grades
    with their university record. They find that the mode of the survey—telephone
    interview conducted by a human, telephone interview conducted by a computer, or
    an internet survey—affected the extent of the measurement error.

    following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, the only available instruments to measure
    radiation had a certain maximum limit. While the radiation was measured as being
    at that (maximum) level, the implication was that the actual value was much higher.

    experiment is conducted, and then patients are followed for ten years. At the
    end of that ten-year period all we know is whether a patient lived at least ten
    years, not the exact length of their life. Left-censored data is the opposite
    situation. For instance, consider a thermometer that only went down to freezing.
    Even when the actual temperature was less, the thermometer would still register
    that as freezing.

    observe the actual value, but we change it to a less extreme one. For instance,
    if we were considering age then we may change the age of anyone older than 100
    to be 100\. We may do this if we are worried that values that were too large would
    have too significant of an effect.

    those values. For instance, consider a situation in which we were interested in
    the relationship between a child’s age and height. Our first question might be
    “what is your age?” and if it turns out the respondent is an adult, then we would
    not continue to ask height. Truncated data are especially closely related to selection
    bias. For instance, consider a student who drops a course—their opinion is not
    measured on course evaluations.

    which the actual distribution of newborn baby weight has a normal distribution,
    centered around 3.5kg. Imagine there is some defect with the scale, such that
    any value less than or equal to 2.75kg is assigned 2.75kg. And imagine there is
    some rule such that any baby expected to weigh more than 4.25kg is transferred
    to a different hospital to be born. These three scenarios are illustrated in [Figure 6.1](#fig-babyweights).
    We may also be interested in considering the mean weight, which highlights the
    bias ([Table 6.1](#tbl-meansofscenarios)).

    insufficient consideration, there is the danger of missing data that we do not

    observe a null, even though there should be an actual value. But it is usually
    considered in its own right. And there are different extents of non-response:
    from refusing to even respond to the survey, through to just missing one question.
    Non-response is a key issue, especially with non-probability samples, because
    there is usually good reason to consider that people who do not respond are systematically
    different to those who do. And this serves to limit the extent to which the survey
    can be used to speak to more than just survey respondents. Gelman et al. ([2016](99-references.html#ref-gelman2016mythical))
    go so far as to say that much of the changes in public opinion that are reported
    in the lead-up to an election are not people changing their mind, but differential
    non-response. That is, individual choosing whether to respond to a survey at all
    depending on the circumstances, not just choosing which survey response to choose.
    The use of pre-notification and reminders may help address non-response in some
    circumstances ([Koitsalu et al. 2018](99-references.html#ref-koitsalu2018effects);
    [Frandell et al. 2021](99-references.html#ref-frandell2021effects)).'

    is in test taking. Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a
    comparison across countries of the performance of 15-year-olds in various standardized
    tests. Canada tends to rank highly. But Anders et al. ([2020](99-references.html#ref-Anders2020))
    show that in 2015 only half of Canadian 15-year-olds were in the sample compared
    with over 90 per cent of some other countries. With comparable samples they find
    that Canada would not appear to over-perform.

- en: Data might be missing because a respondent did not want to respond to one particular
    question, a particular collection of related questions, or the entire survey,
    although these are not mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive ([Newman
    2014](99-references.html#ref-missingdatatypes)). In an ideal situation data are
    Missing Completely At Random (MCAR). This rarely occurs, but if it does, then
    inference should still be reflective of the broader population. It is more likely
    that data are Missing At Random (MAR) or Missing Not At Random (MNAR). The extent
    to which we must worry about that differs. For instance, if we are interested
    in the effect of gender on political support, then it may be that men are less
    likely to respond to surveys, but this is not related to who they will support.
    If that differential response is only due to being a man, and not related to political
    support, then we may be able to continue, provided we include gender in the regression,
    or are able to post-stratify based on gender. That said, the likelihood of this
    independence holding is low, and it is more likely, as in Gelman et al. ([2016](99-references.html#ref-gelman2016mythical)),
    that there is a relationship between responding to the survey and political support.
    In that more likely case, we may have a more significant issue. One approach would
    be to consider additional explanatory variables. It is tempting to drop incomplete
    cases, but this may further bias the sample, and requires justification and the
    support of simulation. Data imputation could be considered, but again may bias
    the sample. Ideally we could rethink, and improve, the data collection process.

    of being used as datasets. One thinks here especially of censuses of population.
    Whitby ([2020, 30–31](99-references.html#ref-whitby)) describes how the earliest
    censuses for which we have written record are from China’s Yellow River Valley.
    One motivation for censuses was taxation, and Jones ([1953](99-references.html#ref-jones1953census))
    describes census records from the late third or early fourth century A.D. which
    enabled a new system of taxation. Detailed records, such as censuses, have also
    been abused. For instance, Luebke and Milton ([1994, 25](99-references.html#ref-luebke1994locating))
    set out how the Nazis used censuses and police registration datasets to “locate
    groups eventually slated for deportation and death”. And Bowen ([2022, 17](99-references.html#ref-clairemckaybowen))
    describes how the United States Census Bureau provided information that contributed
    to the internship of Japanese Americans. President Clinton apologized for this
    in the 1990s.

    statistics like surveys of economic conditions such as unemployment, inflation,
    and GDP. Interestingly, Rockoff ([2019](99-references.html#ref-rockoff2019controversies))
    describes how these economic statistics were not actually developed by the federal
    government, even though governments typically eventually took over that role.
    Censuses and other government-run surveys have the power, and financial resources,
    of the state behind them, which enables them to be thorough in a way that other
    datasets cannot be. For instance, the 2020 United States Census is estimated to
    have cost US$15.6 billion ([Hawes 2020](99-references.html#ref-Hawes2020Implementing)).
    But this similarly brings a specific perspective. Census data, like all data,
    are not unimpeachable. Common errors include under- and over-enumeration, as well
    as misreporting ([Steckel 1991](99-references.html#ref-steckel1991quality)). There
    are various measures and approaches used to assess quality ([Statistics Canada
    2023](99-references.html#ref-statcanhistory)).

    but not unimpeachable. Anderson and Fienberg ([1999](99-references.html#ref-anderson1999counts))
    describe how the history of the census in the United States is one of undercount,
    and that even George Washington complained about this in the 1790s. The extent
    of the undercount was estimated due to the Selective Service registration system
    used for conscription in World War II. Those records were compared with census
    records, and it was found that there were about half a million more men recorded
    for conscription purposes than in the census. This was race-specific, with an
    average undercount of around 3 per cent, but an undercount of Black men of draft
    age of around 13 per cent ([Anderson and Fienberg 1999, 29](99-references.html#ref-anderson1999counts)).
    This became a political issue in the 1960s, and race and ethnicity related questions
    were of special concern in the 1990s. Nobles ([2002, 47](99-references.html#ref-nobles2002racial))
    discusses how counting by race first requires that race exists, but that this
    may be biologically difficult to establish. Despite how fundamental race is to
    the United States census it is not something that is “fixed” and “objective” but
    instead has influences from class, social, legal, structural, and political aspects
    ([Nobles 2002, 48](99-references.html#ref-nobles2002racial)).* **Shoulders of

    similarly large and established source of data are from long-running large surveys.
    These are conducted on a regular basis, and while not usually directly conducted
    by the government, they are usually funded, one way or another, by the government.
    For instance, here we often think of electoral surveys, such as the Canadian Election
    Study, which has run in association with every federal election since 1965, and
    similarly the British Election Study which has been associated with every general
    election since 1964.'

    underlying principle—that the government should make available the data that it
    has—is undeniable. But the term has become a little contentious because of how
    it has occurred in practice. Governments only provide data that they want to provide.
    We may even sometimes see manipulation of data to suit a government’s narrative
    ([Kalgin 2014](99-references.html#ref-Kalgin2014); [Zhang et al. 2019](99-references.html#ref-Zhang2019);

    is to submit a Freedom of Information (FOI) request ([Walby and Luscombe 2019](99-references.html#ref-walby2019freedom)).

    count its population. Whitelaw ([1805](99-references.html#ref-whitelaw1805)) describes
    how population estimates at the time varied considerably. For instance, the estimated
    size of London at the time ranged from 128,570 to 300,000 people. Whitelaw expected
    that the Lord Mayor of Dublin could compel the person in charge of each house
    to affix a list of the inhabitants of that house to the door, and then Whitelaw
    could simply use this.

    classes always contained some individual who was competent to the task [of making
    a list]”. But that “among the lower class, which forms the great mass of the population
    of this city, the case was very different”. It is difficult to see how Whitelaw
    could have known that without going into the houses of both upper and lower classes.

    class and counting their number. It may be that different approaches were needed.

    census more than one per cent of the population listed their religion as “Jedi”
    ([Taylor 2015](99-references.html#ref-nzjedis)). The most important aspect to
    be clear about with probability sampling is the role of uncertainty. This allows

    Specifically, with cluster sampling, we do not intend to collect data from every
    cluster, whereas with stratified sampling we do. With stratified sampling we look
    at every stratum and conduct simple random sampling within each strata to select
    the sample. With cluster sampling we select clusters of interest. We can then
    either sample every unit in those selected clusters or use simple random sampling,
    within the selected clusters, to select units. That all said, this difference
    can become less clear in practice, especially after the fact. Rose et al. ([2006](99-references.html#ref-rose2006comparison))

    unique to this sample, our estimate of the population sum, based on the scaling,
    are revealing. The closest is stratified sample, closely followed by systematic
    sampling. Cluster sampling is a little over 10 per cent off, while simple random
    sampling is a little further away. To get close to the true sum, it is important
    that our sampling method gets as many of the higher values as possible. And so
    stratified and systematic sampling, both of which ensured that we had outcomes
    from the larger numbers did particularly well. The performance of cluster and
    simple random sampling would depend on the particular clusters, and units, selected.
    In this case, stratified and systematic sampling ensured that our estimate of
    the sum of the population would not be too far away from the actual population
    sum. Here, we might think of implications for the construction and evaluation
    of measures, such as GDP and other constructions that are summed, and the effect

    population of France, based on the ratio of the number of registered births, which
    was known throughout the country, to the number of inhabitants, which was only
    know for certain communes. He calculated this ratio for the three communes, and
    then scaled it, based on knowing the number of births across the whole country
    to produce an estimate of the population of France ([Lohr [1999] 2022](99-references.html#ref-lohr)).

    instance, imagine that we knew the total number of hours that a toddler slept
    for a 30-day period, and we want to know how many hours the parents slept over
    that same period. We may have some information on the number of hours that a toddler
    sleeps overnight, \(x\), and the number of hours their parents sleep overnight,
    \(y\), over a 30-day period.

    number of hours that the parents slept is \(185 \times 0.8 = 148\). This turns
    out to be almost exactly right, as the sum is 147\. In this example, the estimate
    was not needed because we were able to sum the data, but say some other set of
    parents only recorded the number of hours that their toddler slept, not how long
    they slept, then we could use this to estimate how much they had slept.

- en: One variant of the ratio estimator that is commonly used is capture and recapture,
    which is one of the crown jewels of data gathering. It is commonly used in ecology
    where we know we can never gather data about all animals. Instead, a sample is
    captured, marked, and released. The researchers return after some time to capture
    another sample. Assuming enough time passes that the initially captured animals
    had time to integrate back into the population, but not so much time has passed
    that there are insurmountable concerns around births, deaths, and migration, then
    we can use these values to estimate a population size. The key is what proportion
    in this second sample have been recaptured. This proportion can be used to estimate
    the size of the whole population. Interestingly, in the 1990s there was substantial
    debate about whether to use a capture-recapture model to adjust the 1990 US census
    due to concerns about methodology. The combination of Breiman ([1994](99-references.html#ref-Breiman1994))
    and Gleick ([1990](99-references.html#ref-newwoyktimesgleickcensus)) provides
    an overview of the concerns at the time, those of censuses more generally, and
    helpful background on capture and recapture methods. More recently we have seen
    capture and recapture combined with web scraping, which we consider in [Chapter
    7](07-gather.html), for the construction of survey frames ([Hyman, Sartore, and
    Young 2021](99-references.html#ref-Hyman2021)).******  ***### 6.4.3 Non-probability
    samples

- en: While acknowledging that it is a spectrum, much of statistics was developed
    based on probability sampling. But a considerable amount of modern sampling is
    done using non-probability sampling. One approach is to use social media and other
    advertisements to recruit a panel of respondents, possibly in exchange for compensation.
    This panel is then the group that is sent various surveys as necessary. But think
    for a moment about the implications of this. For instance, what type of people
    are likely to respond to such an advertisement? Is the richest person in the world
    likely to respond? Are especially young or especially old people likely to respond?
    In some cases, it is possible to do a census. Governments typically do one every
    five to ten years. But there is a reason that it is generally governments that
    do them—they are expensive, time-consuming, and surprisingly, they are sometimes
    not as accurate as we may hope because of how general they need to be.

- en: Non-probability samples have an important role to play because they are typically
    cheaper and quicker to obtain than probability samples. Beaumont ([2020](99-references.html#ref-beaumont2020probability))
    describes a variety of factors in favor of non-probability samples including declining
    response rates to probability samples, and increased demand for real-time statistics.
    Further, as we have discussed, the difference between probability and non-probability
    samples is sometimes one of degree, rather than dichotomy. Non-probability samples
    are legitimate and appropriate for some tasks provided one is clear about the
    trade-offs and ensures transparency ([Baker et al. 2013](99-references.html#ref-nonprobabilitysmaples)).
    Low response rates mean that true probability samples are rare, and so grappling
    with the implications of non-probability sampling is important.

    For instance, one often asks one’s friends and family to fill out a survey as
    a way of testing it before wide-scale distribution. If we were to analyze such
    a sample, then we would likely be using convenience sampling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main concern with convenience sampling is whether it is able to speak to
    the broader population. There are also tricky ethical considerations, and typically
    a lack of anonymity which may further bias the results. On the other hand, it
    can be useful to cheaply get a quick sense of a situation.

- en: Quota sampling occurs when we have strata, but we do not use random sampling
    within those strata to select the unit. For instance, if we again stratified the
    United States based on state, but then instead of ensuring that everyone in Wyoming
    had the chance to be chosen for that stratum, just picked people at Jackson Hole.
    There are some advantages to this approach, especially in terms of speed and cost,
    but the resulting sample may be biased in various ways. That is not to say they
    are without merit. For instance, the Bank of Canada runs a non-probability survey
    focused on the method of payment for goods and services. They use quota sampling,
    and various adjustment methods. This use of non-probability sampling enables them
    to deliberately focus on hard-to-reach aspects of the population ([H. Chen, Felt,
    and Henry 2018](99-references.html#ref-chen20182017)).

    of that in our sampling. Although Handcock and Gile ([2011](99-references.html#ref-handcock2011comment))
    describe various uses before this, and it is notoriously difficult to define attribution
    in multidisciplinary work, snowball sampling is nicely defined by Goodman ([1961](99-references.html#ref-goodman1961snowball)).
    Following Goodman ([1961](99-references.html#ref-goodman1961snowball)), to conduct
    snowball sampling, we first draw a random sample from the sampling frame. Each
    of these is asked to name \(k\) others also in the sample population, but not
    in that initial draw, and these form the “first stage”. Each individual in the
    first stage is then similarly asked to name \(k\) others who are also in the sample
    population, but again not in the random draw or the first stage, and these form
    the “second stage”. We need to have specified the number of stages, \(s\), and
    also \(k\) ahead of time.

    samples from half a million UK participants. One use is to look at a respondent’s
    whole genome sequencing data and then relate it to various conditions they have
    to better understand the extent of genetic determinant.

    of the letters A, T, C, and G, of a length of around 3 billion. For each individual,
    simulate only a length of 12 in total, made up of four groups of three letters.
    Then consider four conditions: colon cancer, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson’s disease,
    and skin cancer. Create some probability association between different three letter
    combinations in your simulated genome sequences and whether a person has that
    condition. For instance, perhaps having AAA in the first three positions, is associated
    with five percent higher rate of colon cancer. Pretend that UK Biobank uses simple
    random sampling. Don’t forget to set a seed.'

    should use family-based sampling. That is, they would cluster at the level of
    families. We would expect that families would have similar (but not necessarily
    the same) sequences. Please redo your simulation to assume families of sizes one
    to five.

    easier for the collectors, because if they are collecting data about one member
    of the family then it may be slightly more convenient to collect data about another
    member of that family. Discuss the difference between probability and non-probability
    sampling and the nuances of the distinction.

    obtained by finding the middle number and then multiplying that by one plus the
    number. In this case, we have \(50 \times 101\). Alternatively we can use R: `sum(1:100)`.[↩︎](#fnref1)'
