Instead, we will use <em>intrinsic</em> functions mapping to these instructions that are available in modern C/C++ compilers.</p><p>In this section, we will go through the basics of their syntax, and in the rest of this chapter, we will use them extensively to do things that are actually interesting.</p><span class="anchor" id="setup"/><h2><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/simd/intrinsics/#setup">#</a>Setup</h2><p>To use x86 intrinsics, we need to do a little groundwork.</p><p>First, we need to determine which extensions are supported by the hardware. On Linux, you can call <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code>, and on other platforms, you’d better go to <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/WikiChip">WikiChip</a> and look it up there using the name of the CPU. In either case, there should be a <code>flags</code> section that lists the codes of all supported vector extensions.</p><p>There is also a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID">CPUID</a> assembly instruction that lets you query various information about the CPU, including the support of particular vector extensions. It is primarily used to get such information in runtime and avoid distributing a separate binary for each microarchitecture. Its output information is returned very densely in the form of feature masks, so compilers provide built-in methods to make sense of it. Here is an example:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class="cp">

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The main challenge of using SIMD is getting the data into contiguous fixed-sized blocks suitable for loading into registers. In the code above, we may in general have a problem if the length of the array is not divisible by the block size. There are two common solutions to this:</p><ol><li>We can “overshoot” by iterating over the last incomplete segment either way. To make sure we don’t segfault by trying to read from or write to a memory region we don’t own, we need to pad the arrays to the nearest block size (typically with some “neutral” element, e.g., zero).</li><li>Make one iteration less and write a little loop in the end that calculates the remainder normally (with scalar operations).</li></ol><p>Humans prefer #1 because it is simpler and results in less code, and compilers prefer #2 because they don’t really have another legal option.</p><span class="anchor" id="instruction-references"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/simd/intrinsics/#instruction-references">#</a>Instruction References</h3><p>Most SIMD intrinsics follow a naming convention similar to <code>_mm&lt;size&gt;_&lt;action&gt;_&lt;type&gt;</code> and correspond to a single analogously named assembly instruction. They become relatively self-explanatory once you get used to the assembly naming conventions, although sometimes it does seem like their names were generated by cats walking on keyboards (explain this: <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#ig_expand=3037,3009,4870,4870,4872,4875,833,879,874,849,848,6715,4845,6046,3853,288,6570,6527,6527,90,7307,6385,5993,2692,6946,6949,5456,6938,5456,1021,3007,514,518,4875,7253,7183,3892,5135,5260,5259,6385,3915,4027,3873,7401&amp;techs=AVX,AVX2&amp;text=punpcklqdq">punpcklqdq</a>).</p><p>Here are a few more examples, just so that you get the gist of it:</p><ul><li><code>_mm_add_epi16</code>: add two 128-bit vectors of 16-bit <em>extended packed integers</em>, or simply said, <code>short</code>s.</li><li><code>_mm256_acos_pd</code>: calculate elementwise $\arccos$ for 4 <em>packed doubles</em>.</li><li><code>_mm256_broadcast_sd</code>: broadcast (copy) a <code>double</code> from a memory location to all 4 elements of the result vector.</li><li><code>_mm256_ceil_pd</code>: round up each of 4 <code>double</code>s to the nearest integer.</li><li><code>_mm256_cmpeq_epi32</code>: compare 8+8 packed <code>int</code>s and return a mask that contains ones for equal element pairs.</li><li><code>_mm256_blendv_ps</code>: pick elements from one of two vectors according to a mask.</li></ul><p>As you may have guessed, there is a combinatorially very large number of intrinsics, and in addition to that, some instructions also have immediate values — so their intrinsics require compile-time constant parameters: for example, the floating-point comparison instruction <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16988199/how-to-choose-avx-compare-predicate-variants">has 32 different modifiers</a>.</p><p>For some reason, there are some operations that are agnostic to the type of data stored in registers, but only take a specific vector type (usually 32-bit float) — you just have to convert to and from it to use that intrinsic. To simplify the examples in this chapter, we will mostly work with 32-bit integers (<code>epi32</code>) in 256-bit AVX2 registers.</p><p>A very helpful reference for x86 SIMD intrinsics is the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Intrinsics Guide</a>, which has groupings by categories and extensions, descriptions, pseudocode, associated assembly instructions, and their latency and throughput on Intel microarchitectures. You may want to bookmark that page.</p><p>The Intel reference is useful when you know that a specific instruction exists and just want to look up its name or performance info. When you don’t know whether it exists, this <a href="https://db.in.tum.de/~finis/x86%20intrinsics%20cheat%20sheet%20v1.0.pdf">cheat sheet</a> may do a better job.</p><p><strong>Instruction selection.</strong> Note that compilers do not necessarily pick the exact instruction that you specify. Similar to the scalar <code>c = a + b</code> we <a href="/hpc/analyzing-performance/assembly">discussed before</a>, there is a fused vector addition instruction too, so instead of using 2+1+1=4 instructions per loop cycle, compiler <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/dMz8E5Ye8">rewrites the code above</a> with blocks of 3 instructions like this:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">vmovapd</span> <span class="nv">ymm1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">YMMWORD</span> <span class="nv">PTR</span> <span class="nv">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">rax</span><span class="p">]</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sometimes, although quite rarely, this compiler interference makes things worse, so it is always a good idea to <a href="/hpc/compilation/stages">check the assembly</a> and take a closer look at the emitted vector instructions (they usually start with a “v”).</p><p>Also, some of the intrinsics don’t map to a single instruction but a short sequence of them, as a convenient shortcut: <a href="../moving#register-aliasing">broadcasts and extracts</a> are a notable example.</p><span class="anchor" id="gcc-vector-extensions"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/simd/intrinsics/#gcc-vector-extensions">#</a>GCC Vector Extensions</h3><p>If you feel like the design of C intrinsics is terrible, you are not alone. I’ve spent hundreds of hours writing SIMD code and reading the Intel Intrinsics Guide, and I still can’t remember whether I need to type <code>_mm256</code> or <code>__m256</code>.</p><p>Intrinsics are not only hard to use but also neither portable nor maintainable. In good software, you don’t want to maintain different procedures for each CPU: you want to implement it just once, in an architecture-agnostic way.</p><p>One day, compiler engineers from the GNU Project thought the same way and developed a way to define your own vector types that feel more like arrays with some operators overloaded to match the relevant instructions.</p><p>In GCC, here is how you can define a vector of 8 integers packed into a 256-bit (32-byte) register:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">v8si</span> <span class="nf">__attribute__</span> <span class="p">((</span> <span class="n">vector_size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">));</span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, this is not a part of the C or C++ standard, so different compilers use different syntax for that.</p><p>There is somewhat of a naming convention, which is to include size and type of elements into the name of the type: in the example above, we defined a “vector of 8 signed integers.” But you may choose any name you want, like <code>vec</code>, <code>reg</code> or whatever. The only thing you don’t want to do is to name it <code>vector</code> because of how much confusion there would be because of <code>std::vector</code>.</p><p>The main advantage of using these types is that for many operations you can use normal C++ operators instead of looking up the relevant intrinsic.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">v4si</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">};</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are also many third-party libraries for different languages that provide a similar capability to write portable SIMD code and also implement some, and just in general are nicer to use than both intrinsics and built-in vector types. Notable examples for C++ are <a href="https://github.com/google/highway">Highway</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jfalcou/eve">Expressive Vector Engine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vectorclass/version2">Vector Class Library</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd">xsimd</a>.</p><p>Using a well-established SIMD library is recommended as it greatly improves the developer experience. In this book, however, we will try to keep close to the hardware and mostly use intrinsics directly, occasionally switching to the vector extensions for simplicity when we can.</p><section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><hr/><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>AVX512 also added 8 so-called <em>mask registers</em> named <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>, which are used for masking and blending data.
