- en: In this case study, we implemented semi-implicit friction between simulated
    objects and a slope, accommodating arbitrary orientations and positions. Within
    the optimization time integration framework of IPC, friction is also modeled using
    potential energy. The key difference is that the normal force magnitude and tangent
    operator are precomputed at the start of each time step for semi-implicit discretization.

    involve obstacles or boundary nodes moving in a prescribed manner, actively injecting
    dynamics into the scene.
