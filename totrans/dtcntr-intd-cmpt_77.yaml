- en: This book (DCIC) is often compared to [How to Design Programs](https://www.htdp.org/)
    (HtDP), from which it draws enormous inspiration. Here we briefly describe how
    the two books compare.

- en: Both are built around the centrality of data structure. Both want to provide
    methods for designing programs. Both start with functional programming but transition
    to (and take very seriously) stateful imperative programming.

- en: 'Both are built around languages carefully designed with education in mind.
    The languages provide special support for writing examples and tests; error reporting
    designed for beginners; built-in images and reactivity. The languages eschew weird
    gotchas (in a way that Python does not: see [Pyret vs. Python](pyret-vs-python.html)
    or, if you want to read much more, [this paper](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/)).'

    these ideas from HtDP; in some cases, HtDP even pioneered them.

- en: Now for the differences. Note that they are differences now. Some ideas from
    DCIC are going to HtDP, and over time more may intermingle.

- en: 'The most obvious is that DCIC is in Pyret. HtDP has tons of good ideas, all
    ignored because it uses Racket, whose syntax some people (especially some educators)
    dislike. We built Pyret to embody good ideas we’d learned from the Racket student
    languages and other good ideas of our own, but package them in a familiar syntax.
    But as you can see, the two languages are not actually that far apart: [Pyret
    for Racketeers and Schemers](p4rs.html).'

- en: The next most obvious thing is that DCIC also includes Python. HtDP has a (not
    formally published) follow-up that [teaches program design in Java](https://felleisen.org/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf).
    In contrast, we wanted to integrate the transition to Python into DCIC itself.
    There’s much to be learned from the contrast! In particular, Pyret and its environment
    were carefully designed around pedagogic ideas for teaching state. Python was
    not, despite the ubiquity and difficulty of state! So there’s a lot to be gained,
    when introducing state, to contrast them.

- en: Next, DCIC has a lot algorithmic content, whereas HtDP has almost none. DCIC
    covers, for instance, Big-O analysis [[Predicting Growth](predicting-growth.html)].
    It even has a section on amortized analysis [[Halloween Analysis](amortized-analysis.html)].
    It goes up through some graph algorithms. This is far more advanced material than
    HtDP covers.

- en: Those are most of the differences. They’re visible (some even evident) from
    glancing through the table of contents. However, there is one very deep difference
    that will not be apparent to most readers, which we discuss below.

- en: 'HtDP is built around a beautiful idea: the data structures shown grow in complexity
    in set-theoretic terms. Therefore it begins with atomic data, then has fixed-size
    data (structures), then unbounded collections (lists) of atomic data, pairs of
    lists, lists of structures, and so on. All built up, systematically, in a neat
    progression.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this has a downside. You have to imagine what the data represent (this
    number is an age, that string is a name, that list is of GDPs), but they’re idealized.
    In a way the most real data are actually images! After that (which come early),
    all the data are “virtualized” and imaginary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Our view is that the most interesting data are lists of structures. (Remember
    those? They’re complicated and come some ways down the progression.) You might
    find this surprising; if so, we give you another name for them: tables. Tables
    are ubiquitous. Even companies process and publish them; even primary school students
    recognize and use them. They are perhaps our most important universal form of
    structured data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even better, lots of real-world data are provided as tables. You don’t have
    to imagine things or make up fake GDPs like 1, 2, and 3\. You can get actual GDPs
    or populations or movie revenues or sports standings or whatever interests you.
    (Ideally, cleansed and curated.) We believe that just about every student—<wbr>even
    every child—<wbr>is a nascent data scientist (at least when it’s convenient to
    them). Even a child who says “I hate math” will often gladly use statistics to
    argue for their favorite actor or sportsperson or whatever. We just have to find
    what motivates them.

- en: Buut there’s a big catch! A key feature of HtDP is that for every level of datatype,
    it provides a Design Recipe for programming over that datatype. Lists-of-structs
    are complex. So is their programming recipe. And we want to put them near the
    beginning! Furthermore, the Design Recipe is dangerous to ignore. Students struggle
    with blank pages and often fill them up with bad code, which they then get attached
    to. The Design Recipe provides structure, scaffolding, reviewability, and much
    more. It’s cognitively grounded in schemas.

- en: So over the past few years, we’ve been working on different program design methods
    that address the same ends through different means. A lot of our recent education
    research has been putting new foundations in place. It’s very much work in progress.
    And DCIC is the distillation of those efforts. As we have new results, we’ll be
    weaving them into DCIC (and probably HtDP too). Stay tuned!
