- en: To mitigate tunneling issues in solid simulation with large time steps, it is
    crucial to enforce non-negativity constraints of signed distances between solids
    and obstacles throughout the entire motion trajectory, not just at the final solution.

- en: While directly using the optimization path to approximate the motion trajectory
    isn't perfect theoretically, it supports the design of a filter line search scheme.
    This scheme utilizes continuous collision detection (CCD) and the projected Newton
    method, effectively preventing tunneling in practical scenarios.

- en: The projected Newton method, a gradient-based approach for minimizing the Incremental
    Potential, requires that the potential energy has a continuous gradient. Consequently,
    the distance functions employed in our barrier potential need to be at least C1
    continuous. For grid-based signed distance fields ([Example 7.1.3](lec7.1-signed_dists.html#exp:lec7:grid_sdf)),
    mere bilinear interpolation is considered insufficient.

- en: Additionally, handling self-contact on the piece-wise linear boundary of a mesh
    necessitates further approximations to smooth the distance function. Detailed
    exploration of self-contact will be addressed in [future sections](lec20-pw_linear_boundary.html).
    Before that, we will first transition to discussing solids-obstacle friction in
    our next lecture.
