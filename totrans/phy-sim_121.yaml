- en: In 3D, the contact between the solid domain boundaries represented as triangle
    meshes can be reduced to point-triangle and edge-edge contacts. Intuitively, the
    point-edge contact pairs in 2D extend directly to 3D as point-triangle pairs.
    However, even if we prevent all point-triangle interpenetrations in 3D, the triangle
    meshes can still penetrate each other. This necessitates accounting for edge-edge
    pairs, especially when the resolution of the mesh is not very high.
