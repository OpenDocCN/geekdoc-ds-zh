    language. The goal here is to get your hands dirty right from the start! We will
    walk through an entire data analysis, and along the way introduce different types
    of data analysis question, some fundamental programming concepts in R, and the
    basics of loading, cleaning, and visualizing data. In the following chapters,
    we will dig into each of these steps in much more detail; but for now, let’s jump
    in to see how much we can do with data science!

    to languages spoken at home by Canadian residents (Figure [1.1](intro.html#fig:canada-map)).
    Many Indigenous peoples exist in Canada with their own cultures and languages;
    these languages are often unique to Canada and not spoken anywhere else in the
    world ([Statistics Canada 2018](#ref-statcan2018mothertongue)). Sadly, colonization
    has led to the loss of many of these languages. For instance, generations of children
    were not allowed to speak their mother tongue (the first language an individual
    learns in childhood) in Canadian residential schools. Colonizers also renamed
    places they had “discovered” ([K. Wilson 2018](#ref-wilson2018)). Acts such as
    these have significantly harmed the continuity of Indigenous languages in Canada,
    and some languages are considered “endangered” as few people report speaking them.
    To learn more, please see *Canadian Geographic*’s article, “Mapping Indigenous
    Languages in Canada” ([Walker 2017](#ref-walker2017)), *They Came for the Children:
    Canada, Aboriginal peoples, and Residential Schools* ([Truth and Reconciliation
    Commission of Canada 2012](#ref-children2012)) and the *Truth and Reconciliation

    functions once loaded. The `read_csv` function, in particular, can be made accessible
    by loading [the `tidyverse` R package](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) ([Wickham

    attached packages and conflicts below our code line. These are examples of *messages*
    in R, which give the user more information that might be handy to know. The `Attaching
    packages` message is natural when loading `tidyverse`, since `tidyverse` actually
    automatically causes other packages to be imported too, such as `dplyr`. In the
    future, when we load `tidyverse` in this book, we will silence these messages
    to help with the readability of the book. The `Conflicts` message is also totally
    normal in this circumstance. This message tells you if functions from different
    packages share the same name, which is confusing to R. For example, in this case,
    the `dplyr` package and the `stats` package both provide a function called `filter`.
    The message above (`dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()`) is R telling you that
    it is going to default to the `dplyr` package version of this function. So if
    you use the `filter` function, you will be using the `dplyr` version. In order
    to use the `stats` version, you need to use its full name `stats::filter`. Messages

    we suggest using only lowercase letters, numbers and underscores `_` to separate
    the words in a name. R is case sensitive, which means that `Letter` and `letter`
    would be two different objects in R. You should also try to give your objects
    meaningful names. For instance, you *can* name a data frame `x`. However, using
    more meaningful terms, such as `language_data`, will help you remember what each
    name in your code represents. We recommend following the Tidyverse naming conventions
    outlined in the *Tidyverse Style Guide* ([Wickham 2020](#ref-tidyversestyleguide)).

    from a data frame. Figure [1.4](intro.html#fig:img-filter) outlines what arguments
    we need to specify to use `filter`. The first argument to `filter` is the name
    of the data frame object, `can_lang`. The second argument is a *logical statement*
    to use when filtering the rows. A logical statement evaluates to either `TRUE`
    or `FALSE`; `filter` keeps only those rows for which the logical statement evaluates
    to `TRUE`. For example, in our analysis, we are interested in keeping only languages
    in the “Aboriginal languages” higher-level category. We can use the *equivalency
    operator* `==` to compare the values of the `category` column with the value `"Aboriginal
    languages"`; you will learn about many other kinds of logical statements in Chapter
    [3](wrangling.html#wrangling). Similar to when we loaded the data file and put
    quotes around the file name, here we need to put quotes around `"Aboriginal languages"`.
    Using quotes tells R that this is a string *value* and not one of the special

    The data frame `aboriginal_lang` contains only 67 rows, and looks like it only
    contains languages in the “Aboriginal languages” in the `category` column. So
    it looks like the function gave us the result we wanted!

    are the column names that we want to select: `language` and `mother_tongue`. After

    `language` and `mother_tongue` columns that we asked for) as a data frame. This
    code is also a great example of why being able to name things in R is useful:

    data frame as the first argument to this function, and the variable to order by
    as the second argument. Since we want to choose the ten Aboriginal languages most
    often reported as a mother tongue language, we will use the `arrange` function
    to order the rows in our `selected_lang` data frame by the `mother_tongue` column.

    we pass the column to the `desc` function before using it as an argument.

- en: Recall that our data analysis question referred to the *count* of Canadians
    that speak each of the top ten most commonly reported Aboriginal languages as
    their mother tongue, and the `ten_lang` data frame indeed contains those counts…
    But perhaps, seeing these numbers, we became curious about the *percentage* of
    the population of Canada associated with each count. It is common to come up with
    new data analysis questions in the process of answering a first one—so fear not
    and explore! To answer this small question along the way, we need to divide each
    count in the `mother_tongue` column by the total Canadian population according
    to the 2016 census—i.e., 35,151,728—and multiply it by 100\. We can perform this
    computation using the `mutate` function. We pass the `ten_lang` data frame as
    its first argument, then specify the equation that computes the percentages in
    the second argument. By using a new variable name on the left hand side of the
    equation, we will create a new column in the data frame; and if we use an existing
    name, we will modify that variable. In this case, we will opt to create a new
    column called `mother_tongue_percent`.

    Even the `ten_lang` table with only two columns presents some difficulty: for
    example, you have to scrutinize the table quite closely to get a sense for the
    relative numbers of speakers of each language. When you move on to more complicated
    analyses, this issue only gets worse. In contrast, a *visualization* would convey
    this information in a much more easily understood format. Visualizations are a
    great tool for summarizing information to help you effectively communicate with
    your audience, and creating effective data visualizations is an essential component
    of any data analysis. In this section we will develop a visualization of the ten
    Aboriginal languages that were most often reported in 2016 as mother tongues in

    but we are not done yet! We can (and should) do more to improve the interpretability
    of the data visualization that we created. For example, by default, R uses the
    column names as the axis labels. Usually these column names do not have enough
    information about the variable in the column. We really should replace this default
    with a more informative label. For the example above, R uses the column name `mother_tongue`
    as the label for the y axis, but most people will not know what that is. And even
    if they did, they will not know how we measured this variable, or the group of
    people on which the measurements were taken. An axis label that reads “Mother
    Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)” would be much more informative.

- en: Adding additional layers to our visualizations that we create in `ggplot` is
    one common and easy way to improve and refine our data visualizations. New layers
    are added to `ggplot` objects using the `+` symbol. For example, we can use the
    `xlab` (short for x axis label) and `ylab` (short for y axis label) functions
    to add layers where we specify meaningful and informative labels for the x and
    y axes. Again, since we are specifying words (e.g. `"Mother Tongue (Number of
    Canadian Residents)"`) as arguments to `xlab` and `ylab`, we surround them with
    double quotation marks. We can add many more layers to format the plot further,
