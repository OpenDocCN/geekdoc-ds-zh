- en: In the weak form we derived (see Equation [(16.3.6)](lec16.3-weak_form.html#eq:lec16:weakform_lagrangian)),
    there is a boundary term ∫∂Ω0​Qi​(X,t)Ti​(X,t)ds(X) that describes the force acting
    on the boundary of the solid from the outside.

- en: If there are no Dirichlet boundary conditions, the entire boundary is handled
    using **Neumann Boundary Conditions**, where the boundary force is specified as
    part of the problem setup. Recall that we discussed the [Dirichlet Boundary Condition](./lec5-dirichlet_BC_solve.html),
    where the displacements of the boundary are directly prescribed. In practice,
    external forces act on the Dirichlet boundaries to ensure their displacements
    precisely match the prescribed values, and these forces are calculated directly
    from those displacements.

    the boundary term ∫∂Ω0​Qi​(X,t)Ti​(X,t)ds(X) can be separately considered for

- en: For Neumann boundaries, since the traction TN​(X,t) is provided, the above integral
    can be directly evaluated after discretization. However, for Dirichlet boundaries,
    TD​(X,t) remains unknown until we solve the problem. Therefore, a straightforward
    approach is to introduce the traction at Dirichlet boundaries as unknowns and
    solve the system that includes both the discretized weak form equations and the
    Dirichlet boundary conditions.

- en: '***Remark 18.1.1 (Optimization Form).*** In the [optimization form](./lec2-opt_framework.html),
    the potential energy does not include any Dirichlet boundaries, effectively ignoring
    the boundary integral in the weak form. This is valid because the Dirichlet boundary
    conditions will be enforced by the linear equality constraints, and the corresponding
    discretized weak form equation will be overwritten.'
