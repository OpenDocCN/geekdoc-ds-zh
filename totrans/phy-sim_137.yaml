- en: In this lecture, we discussed modal reduction techniques that dramatically accelerate
    physics-based simulations by projecting high-dimensional systems onto carefully
    chosen low-dimensional subspaces.

- en: Linear modal analysis uses an object's natural vibration modes as basis vectors,
    creating independent 1D oscillators that are extremely efficient to solve. However,
    this approach produces severe artifacts (length stretching, volume changes) for
    large deformations due to its linear assumptions. Nonlinear model reduction extends
    these concepts to handle large deformations by projecting the full nonlinear equations
    of motion. The key challenge is efficiently evaluating reduced forces without
    computing full-space quantities, solved through polynomial fitting for specific
    materials or cubature methods for general cases.

- en: 'The quality of any modal reduction depends critically on basis selection. Two
    main approaches exist: data-driven methods using Principal Component Analysis
    on simulation snapshots, and physics-based modal derivatives that capture nonlinear
    coupling between linear modes without requiring expensive pre-simulations.'
