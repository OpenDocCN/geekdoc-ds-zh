    rotation-aware while maintaining its simplicity, we can introduce a base rotation
    Rn and construct an energy density function ΨLC​(F)=Ψlin​((Rn)TF), penalizing
    any deviation between F and this fixed Rn. This is called corotated linear elasticity.'

    dynamic simulations. At the beginning of the optimization for each time step n+1,
    we compute Rn as the closest rotation to Fn: Rn=argRmin​∥Fn−R∥F2​s.t.RT=R−1anddet(R)=1.(13.3.1)
    As mentioned earlier, the solution is given by the Polar decomposition on Fn,
    and with Polar SVD Fn=UnΣn(Vn)T, we have Rn=Un(Vn)T. However, corotated linear
    elasticity is still not rotation invariant, as Rn does not change with F during
    the optimization. Thus, it is not suitable for large deformations.'

    been simplifying them for visual computing purposes. For example, only keeping
    a μ-term while ignoring the λ-term in the energy density function for more efficient
    computations: ΨR​(F)=4μ​∥FTF−I∥F2​,orΨARAP​(F)=μi∑d​(σi​−1)2,etc.(13.3.2) Here
    ΨARAP​(F) is called the **As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)** energy, which is widely
    used in shape modeling, cloth simulation, and surface parameterization, etc. ΨR​(F),
    while being a higher-order polynomial of F compared to ARAP, can be computed without
    performing the expensive SVDs on F.'

- en: For all the strain energy density functions we have looked at in this lecture,
    except Neo-Hookean, all others are defined on the whole domain Rd×d. Neo-Hookean
    energy density function is defined on {F ∣ F∈Rd×d, det(F)>0}. Just like the barrier
    energy to prevent interpenetrations in IPC, ΨNH​(F) is also a barrier energy,
    which goes to infinity as det(F) approaches 0, providing arbitrarily large elastic
    forces to prevent **inversion** (det(F)≤0).

- en: Strain energy density functions allowing det(F)≤0 are also called **invertible
    elasticity models**. They are easy to deal with (no need for line search filtering),
    but do not guarantee non-inversion. Designing an invertible elastic energy that
    provides reasonably large resistance to inversion has drawn a lot of attention
