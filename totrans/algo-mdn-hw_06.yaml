- en: Assembly is a very minimal language because it needs to be. It reflects the
    machine language as closely as possible, up to the point where there is almost
    1:1 correspondence between machine code and assembly. In fact, you can turn any
    compiled program back into its assembly form using a process called *disassembly*^([1](#fn:1))
    — although everything non-essential like comments will not be preserved.

- en: Note that the two snippets above are not just syntactically different. Both
    are optimized codes produced by a compiler, but the Arm version uses 4 instructions,
    while the x86 version uses 3\. The `add eax, [rdi]` instruction is what’s called
    *fused instruction* that does a load and an add in one go — this is one of the
    perks that the [CISC](../isa#risc-vs-cisc) approach can provide.

    one, from here on and for the rest of the book we will only provide examples for
    x86, which is probably what most of our readers will optimize for, although many
    of the introduced concepts will be architecture-agnostic.

- en: For historical reasons, instruction mnemonics in most assembly languages are
    very terse. Back when people used to write assembly by hand and repeatedly wrote
    the same set of common instructions, one less character to type was one step away
    from insanity.

    `mul` is for “multiply,” and `idiv` is for “integer division.” You can look up
    the description of an instruction by its name in [one of x86 references](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/),
    but most instructions do what you’d think they do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most instructions write their result into the first operand, which can also
    be involved in the computation like in the `add eax, [rdi]` example we saw before.
    Operands can be either registers, constant values, or memory locations.

- en: '**Registers** are named `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `rbp`, `rsp`,
    and `r8`-`r15` for a total of 16 of them. The “letter” ones are named like that
    for historical reasons: `rax` is “accumulator,” `rcx` is “counter,” `rdx` is “data”
    and so on — but, of course, they don’t have to be used only for that.'

- en: 'There are also 32-, 16-bit and 8-bit registers that have similar names (`rax`
    → `eax` → `ax` → `al`). They are not fully separate but *aliased*: the lowest
    32 bits of `rax` are `eax`, the lowest 16 bits of `eax` are `ax`, and so on. This
    is made to save die space while maintaining compatibility, and it is also the
    reason why basic type casts in compiled programming languages are usually free.'

    use however you like in most instructions. There is also a separate set of registers
    for [floating-point arithmetic](/hpc/arithmetic/float), a bunch of very wide registers
    used in [vector extensions](/hpc/simd), and a few special ones that are needed
    for [control flow](../loops), but we’ll get there in time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Constants** are just integer or floating-point values: `42`, `0x2a`, `3.14`,
    `6.02e23`. They are more commonly called *immediate values* because they are embedded
    right into the machine code. Because it may considerably increase the complexity
    of the instruction encoding, some instructions don’t support immediate values
    or allow just a fixed subset of them. In some cases, you have to load a constant
    value into a register and then use it instead of an immediate value.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from numeric values, there are also string constants such as `hello` or
    `world\n` with their own little subset of operations, but that is a somewhat obscure
    corner of the assembly language that we are not going to explore here.

- en: 'Some instructions may have the same mnemonic, but have different operand types,
    in which case they are considered distinct instructions as they may perform slightly
    different operations and take different times to execute. The `mov` instruction
    is a vivid example of that, as it comes in around 20 different forms, all related
    to moving data: either between the memory and registers or just between two registers.
    Despite the name, it doesn’t *move* a value into a register, but *copies* it,
    preserving the original.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When used to copy data between two registers, the `mov` instruction instead
    performs *register renaming* internally — informs the CPU that the value referred
    by register X is actually stored in register Y — without causing any additional
    delay except for maybe reading and decoding the instruction itself. For the same
    reason, the `xchg` instruction that swaps two registers also doesn’t cost anything.

    it in a register in one cycle, without doing any actual memory operations. While
    its intended use is for actually computing memory addresses, it is also often
    used as an arithmetic trick that would otherwise involve 1 multiplication and
    2 additions — for example, you can multiply by 3, 5, and 9 with it.'

    c` (or even `a = b + c + d` if one of them is a constant).'
