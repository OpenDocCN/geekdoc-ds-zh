    inclusive, Thursday gets number $3$. To find out what day it is going to be in
    a year from now, we need to add $365$ to it and then reduce modulo $7$. Conveniently,
    $365 \bmod 7 = 1$, so we know that it will be Friday unless it is a leap year
    (in which case it will be Saturday).

    evenly. One can just pick a random number from the required range, perform a primality
