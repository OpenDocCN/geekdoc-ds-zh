    a single field `one`. It also mark this structure as a class so that arguments
    of type `One₁ α` for some type `α` will be inferrable using the instance resolution
    procedure, as long as they are marked as instance-implicit, i.e. appear between
    square brackets. Those two effects could also have been achieved using the `structure`
    command with `class` attribute, i.e. writing `@[class] structure` instance of
    `class`. But the class command also ensures that `One₁ α` appears as an instance-implicit

    issue. A ring structure on a type contains both an additive group structure and
    a multiplicative monoid structure, and some properties about their interaction.
    But so far we hard-coded a notation `⋄` for all our operations. More fundamentally,
    the type class system assumes every type has only one instance of each type class.
    There are various ways to solve this issue. Surprisingly Mathlib uses the naive
    idea to duplicate everything for additive and multiplicative theories with the
    help of some code-generating attribute. Structures and classes are defined in
    both additive and multiplicative notation with an attribute `to_additive` linking
    them. In case of multiple inheritance like for semi-groups, the auto-generated
    “symmetry-restoring” instances need also to be marked. This is a bit technical;
    you don’t need to understand details. The important point is that lemmas are then
    only stated in multiplicative notation and marked with the attribute `to_additive`
    to generate the additive version as `left_inv_eq_right_inv'` with its auto-generated
    additive version `left_neg_eq_right_neg'`. In order to check the name of this
    additive version we used the `whatsnew in` command on top of `left_inv_eq_right_inv'`.

    Mathlib does not play this game, first because in practice this does not make
    any ring instance easier and also because Mathlib’s algebraic hierarchy goes through
    semirings which are like rings but without opposites so that the proof below does
    not work for them. What we gain here, besides a nice exercise if you have never
    seen it, is an example of building an instance using the syntax that allows to

    the relevant function is `MonoidHom₁.toFun ∘ RingHom₁.toMonoidHom₁` which is not
    a declaration that can be tagged with an attribute (but we could still define
    a `CoeFun  (RingHom₁ R S) (fun _ ↦ R → S)` instance). A much more important one
    is that lemmas about monoid morphisms won’t directly apply to ring morphisms.
    This leaves the alternative of either juggling with `RingHom₁.toMonoidHom₁` each
    time we want to apply a monoid morphism lemma or restate every such lemmas for
    ring morphisms. Neither option is appealing so Mathlib uses a new hierarchy trick
    here. The idea is to define a type class for objects that are at least monoid
    morphisms, instantiate that class with both monoid morphisms and ring morphisms
    and use it to state every lemma. In the definition below, `F` could be `MonoidHom₁
    M N`, or `RingHom₁ M N` if `M` and `N` have a ring structure.

    There are various ways to solve this issue. Surprisingly Mathlib uses the naive
    idea to duplicate everything for additive and multiplicative theories with the
    help of some code-generating attribute. Structures and classes are defined in
    both additive and multiplicative notation with an attribute `to_additive` linking
    them. In case of multiple inheritance like for semi-groups, the auto-generated
    “symmetry-restoring” instances need also to be marked. This is a bit technical;
    you don’t need to understand details. The important point is that lemmas are then
    only stated in multiplicative notation and marked with the attribute `to_additive`
    to generate the additive version as `left_inv_eq_right_inv'` with its auto-generated
    additive version `left_neg_eq_right_neg'`. In order to check the name of this

    semirings which are like rings but without opposites so that the proof below does

    But so far we hard-coded a notation `⋄` for all our operations. More fundamentally,
    the type class system assumes every type has only one instance of each type class.
    There are various ways to solve this issue. Surprisingly Mathlib uses the naive
    idea to duplicate everything for additive and multiplicative theories with the
    help of some code-generating attribute. Structures and classes are defined in
    both additive and multiplicative notation with an attribute `to_additive` linking
    them. In case of multiple inheritance like for semi-groups, the auto-generated
    “symmetry-restoring” instances need also to be marked. This is a bit technical;
    you don’t need to understand details. The important point is that lemmas are then
    only stated in multiplicative notation and marked with the attribute `to_additive`
    to generate the additive version as `left_inv_eq_right_inv'` with its auto-generated
    additive version `left_neg_eq_right_neg'`. In order to check the name of this

    instance in the database. If you are curious to see the effect of such an instance
    you can type `set_option synthInstance.checkSynthOrder false in` on top of the
    above declaration, replace `def badInst` with `instance`, and look for random
    failures in this file.'

    and then deduce `M` and `N`. This is done using the `outParam` function. This
    function is defined as the identity function, but is still recognized by the type
    class machinery and triggers the desired behavior. Hence we can retry defining
    our class, paying attention to the `outParam` function:'

    a class. But we haven’t. Everything is shifted one level of abstraction up. The
    type class resolution procedure won’t be looking for functions, it will be looking
    for either `MonoidHom₁` or `RingHom₁`.

    the `toFun` field and the corresponding `CoeFun` instance and `coe` attribute.
    It would also be better to record that this pattern is used only for functions
    with extra properties, meaning that the coercion to functions should be injective.
    So Mathlib adds one more layer of abstraction with the base class `DFunLike` (where
    “DFun” stands for dependent function). Let us redefine our `MonoidHomClass` on
    top of this base layer.

    on `RingHom` and then later on `AlgebraHom` (algebras are rings with some extra
    structure). But we’ve covered the main formalization ideas used in Mathlib for
    morphisms and you should be ready to understand how morphisms are defined in Mathlib.

    function between ordered types, and then order preserving monoid morphisms. This
    is for training purposes only. Like continuous functions, order preserving functions
    are primarily unbundled in Mathlib where they are defined by the `Monotone` predicate.
    Of course you need to complete the class definitions below.

    to consider sets that inherit this algebraic structure, for instance subgroups
    or subrings. This largely overlaps with our previous topic. Indeed a set in `X`
    is implemented as a function from `X` to `Prop` so sub-objects are function satisfying
    a certain predicate. Hence we can reuse of lot of the ideas that led to the `DFunLike`
    class and its descendants. We won’t reuse `DFunLike` itself because this would
    break the abstraction barrier from `Set X` to `X → Prop`. Instead there is a `SetLike`
    class. Instead of wrapping an injection into a function type, that class wraps
    an injection into a `Set` type and defines the corresponding coercion and `Membership`
    instance.

    in Mathlib always form a complete lattice, and this structure is used a lot. For
    instance you may look for the lemma saying that an intersection of submonoids
    is a submonoid. But this won’t be a lemma, this will be an infimum construction.

    example instead of the intersection symbol `∩`. But think about the supremum.
    The union of two submonoids is not a submonoid. However submonoids still form
    a lattice (even a complete one). Actually `N ⊔ P` is the submonoid generated by
    the union of `N` and `P` and of course it would be very confusing to denote it
    by `N ∪ P`. So you can see the use of `N ⊓ P` as much more consistent. It is also
    a lot more consistent across various kind of algebraic structures. It may look
    a bit weird at first to see the sum of two vector subspace `E` and `F` denoted
    by `E ⊔ F` instead of `E + F`. But you will get used to it. And soon you will
    consider the `E + F` notation as a distraction emphasizing the anecdotal fact
    that elements of `E ⊔ F` can be written as a sum of an element of `E` and an element
    of `F` instead of emphasizing the fundamental fact that `E ⊔ F` is the smallest
    vector subspace containing both `E` and `F`.
