- en: R comes with some built-in plotting functions such as `plot()`, `hist()` and
    `boxplot()`. Many of these reside in `package:graphics`, which comes pre-loaded
    into the search path. `plot()` on the other hand, is higher up the search path
    in `package:base`–it is a generic method whose methods can reside in many places
    (e.g. in `package:graphics` or some place else).

    the most time learning about. However, there are a large number of third-party
    libraries for plotting that you might consider looking into if you want to use
    a certain aesthetic, or if you want plotting functionality that is specialized
    for certain cases (e.g. geospatial plots).

    S3 objects with special behavior (more information about S3 objects in subsection

    This function initializes figures; it is the function that will take in information
    about *which* data set you want to plot, and *how* you want to plot it. The raw
    data is provided in the first argument. The second argument, `mapping=`, is more
    confusing. The argument should be constructed with the `aes()` function. In the
    parlance of `ggplot2`, `aes()` constructs an **aesthetic mapping**. Think of the
    “aesthetic mapping” as stored information that can be used later on–it “maps”
    data to visual properties of a figure.

    In fact, in `ggplot2`, a layer can be pretty much anything: raw data, summarized
    data, transformed data, annotations, etc. However, the functions that add geometric
    object layers usually start with the prefix `geom_`. In RStudio, after loading

- en: 'We didn’t talk about `tuple`s in chapter 2, but you can think of them as being
    similar to `list`s. They are containers that can hold elements of different types.
    There are a few key differences, though: they are made with parentheses (e.g. `(''a'')`
    ) instead of square brackets, and they are immutable instead of mutable.[↩](/visualization#fnref22)'
