- en: This textbook aims to be an approachable introduction to the world of data science.
    In this book, we define **data science** as the process of generating insight
    from data through **reproducible** and **auditable** processes. If you analyze
    some data and give your analysis to a friend or colleague, they should be able
    to re-run the analysis from start to finish and get the same result you did (*reproducibility*).
    They should also be able to see and understand all the steps in the analysis,
    as well as the history of how the analysis developed (*auditability*). Creating
    reproducible and auditable analyses allows both you and others to easily double-check
    and validate your work.

    learn in each chapter of this book. Throughout, you will learn how to use the
    R programming language ([R Core Team 2021](#ref-Rlanguage)) to perform all the
    tasks associated with data analysis. You will spend the first four chapters learning
    how to use R to load, clean, wrangle (i.e., restructure the data into a usable
    format) and visualize data while answering descriptive and exploratory data analysis
    questions. In the next six chapters, you will learn how to answer predictive,
    exploratory, and inferential data analysis questions with common methods in data
    science, including classification, regression, clustering, and estimation. In
    the final chapters ([11](jupyter.html#jupyter)–[13](setup.html#setup)), you will
    learn how to combine R code, formatted text, and images in a single coherent document
    with Jupyter, use version control for collaboration, and install and configure
    the software needed for data science on your own computer. If you are reading
    this book as part of a course that you are taking, the instructor may have set
    up all of these tools already for you; in this case, you can continue on through
    the book reading the chapters in order. But if you are reading this independently,
    you may want to jump to these last three chapters early before going on to make
    sure your computer is set up in such a way that you can try out the example code
    that we include throughout the book.

    to help you practice the concepts you will learn. We strongly recommend that you
    work through the worksheet when you finish reading each chapter before moving
    on to the next chapter. All of the worksheets are available at [https://worksheets.datasciencebook.ca](https://worksheets.datasciencebook.ca);
    the “Exercises” section at the end of each chapter points you to the right worksheet
    for that chapter. For each worksheet, you can either launch an interactive version
    of the worksheet in your browser by clicking the “launch binder” button, or preview
    a non-interactive version of the worksheet by clicking “view worksheet.” If you
    instead decide to download the worksheet and run it on your own machine, make
    sure to follow the instructions for computer setup found in Chapter [13](setup.html#setup).
    This will ensure that the automated feedback and guidance that the worksheets
    provide will function as intended.
