<p>In iterative minimization methods, line search is a technique used to select a fraction of the step in each iteration, ensuring the objective energy decreases at the new point.</p>
<p>Specifically, for Newton's method, line 4 in <a href="lec1.5-implicit_time_integration.html#alg:lec1:newton_method_IE">Algorithm 1.5.1</a> is modified from \(x^i \leftarrow x\) to \(x^i \leftarrow x^i + \alpha (x - x^i)\), where \(\alpha \in (0,1]\) is the step size, essential for the reduction of energy. This leads to two critical questions: Does such an \(\alpha\) always exist? And how is \(\alpha\) calculated?</p>

<em>Remark 3.2.1 (Existence of \(\alpha\)).</em></strong> For a smooth objective energy \(E(x)\) at \(x^i\) where \(\nabla E(x^i) \neq 0\), if a search direction \(p=x-x^i\) is descent, namely \(p^T \nabla E(x^i) &lt; 0\), then there exists \(\alpha &gt; 0\) such that \(E(x^i + \alpha p) &lt; E(x^i)\).</p>

<strong>Method 3.2.1 (Backtracking Line Search).</strong></strong> Given a descent direction, we can find a reasonably large \(\alpha\) by simply halving it starting from \(1\) until the energy at the new location is smaller than the current (see <a href="#alg:lec3:line_search">Algorithm 3.2.1</a>). <figure>

<em>Remark 3.2.2 (Other Line Search Methods).</em></strong>
There are other line search methods that attempt to apply polynomial interpolations to find an \(\alpha\) such that the energy at the new location is closer to a local minimum on the line segment \(x^i + s p\), (\(s\in(0,1]\)). However, these methods generally incur higher computational costs and may not necessarily enhance the overall wall-clock timing of the optimization.</p>

<p>Now, with line search, if Newton's method consistently generates a descent search direction, then the method is guaranteed to converge for any initial configuration on any smooth energy with a lower bound. We know that in iteration \(i\), \(p = -(\nabla^2 E(x^i))^{-1} \nabla E(x^i)\), so \(p^T \nabla E(x^i)\) equals \(-\nabla E(x^i)^T (\nabla^2 E(x^i))^{-T} \nabla E(x^i)\). For convex energies, \(\nabla^2 E(x^i)\) is always Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD), and so is \((\nabla^2 E(x^i))^{-T}\), making \(p\) always a descent direction. However, for non-convex energies, this assurance does not always hold. One approach to address this issue is to approximate the energies locally using convex energy proxies.</p>
