- en: Kinematics is the study of motion within continuum materials, focusing primarily
    on the changes in shape or deformation that occur, whether locally or globally,
    across different coordinate systems. The aim is to describe motion both qualitatively
    and quantitatively, which is crucial for deriving the governing equations of dynamics
    and mechanical responses. Notably, kinematics can often be described without the
    need to introduce concepts like force, stress, or even mass.

    continuum mechanics is determined by a mapping ϕ(⋅,t):Ω0→Ωt, where Ω0,Ωt⊂Rd and
    d=2 or 3 represents the dimension of the simulated problem (or domain). This mapping,
    often referred to as the flow map or the deformation map, is crucial in understanding
    how material points move over time.'

    direction n, then we have x=X+tvn.(12.1.1) If an object undergoes some rigid motion
    after time t (compared to time 0), we will have x=RX+b,(12.1.2) where R is a rotation
    matrix, and b is some translation. R and b will likely be functions of time t
    and the initial position X, depending on the actual motion.'

    example, the velocity of a given material point X at time t is V(X,t)=∂t∂ϕ​(X,t),(12.1.3)
    and the acceleration is A(X,t)=∂t2∂2ϕ​(X,t)=∂t∂V​(X,t).(12.1.4) That is, V(⋅,t):Ω0→Rd
    and A(⋅,t):Ω0→Rd.

    from the Lagrangian perspective. This means that both velocity and acceleration
    are functions of the material configuration X and time t, focusing on specific
    particles within the material. Physically, this implies that these measurements
    pertain to particles that have their own mass and have occupied some volume from
    the beginning of the simulation. The Lagrangian view is particularly valuable
    for tracking individual particle dynamics over time, offering detailed insights
    into how particles move, accelerate, and interact within the material under various
    conditions.'
