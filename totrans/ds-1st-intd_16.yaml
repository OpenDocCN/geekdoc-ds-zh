    writing text and displaying images that help tell the story of the analysis. In
    fact, ideally, we would like to *interleave* these three media, with the text
    and images serving as narration for the code and its output. In this chapter we
    will show you how to accomplish this using Jupyter notebooks, a common coding
    platform in data science. Jupyter notebooks do precisely what we need: they let
    you combine text, images, and (executable!) code in a single document. In this
    chapter, we will focus on the *use* of Jupyter notebooks to program in R and write
    text via a web interface. These skills are essential to getting your analysis
    running; think of it like getting dressed in the morning! Note that we assume
    that you already have Jupyter set up and ready to use. If that is not the case,
    please first read Chapter [13](setup.html#setup) to learn how to install and configure
    Jupyter on your own computer.'

- en: Jupyter ([Kluyver et al. 2016](#ref-kluyver2016jupyter)) is a web-based interactive
    development environment for creating, editing, and executing documents called
    Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are documents that contain a mix of computer
    code (and its output) and formattable text. Given that they combine these two
    analysis artifacts in a single document—code is not separate from the output or
    written report—notebooks are one of the leading tools to create reproducible data
    analyses. Reproducible data analysis is one where you can reliably and easily
    re-create the same results when analyzing the same data. Although this sounds
    like something that should always be true of any data analysis, in reality, this
    is not often the case; one needs to make a conscious effort to perform data analysis
    in a reproducible manner. An example of what a Jupyter notebook looks like is
    shown in Figure [11.1](jupyter.html#fig:img-jupyter).

    and collaboration tools installed, configured and ready to use. JupyterHubs are
    usually created and provisioned by organizations, and require authentication to
    gain access. For example, if you are reading this book as part of a course, your
    instructor may have a JupyterHub already set up for you to use! Jupyter can also
    be installed on your own computer; see Chapter [13](setup.html#setup) for instructions.

    brackets to the left of the cell (Figure [11.2](jupyter.html#fig:code-cell-not-run)).
    Running a code cell will execute all of the code it contains, and the output (if
    any exists) will be displayed directly underneath the code that generated it.
    Outputs may include printed text or numbers, data frames and data visualizations.
    Cells that have been executed also have a number inside the square brackets to
    the left of the cell. This number indicates the order in which the cells were
    run (Figure [11.3](jupyter.html#fig:code-cell-run)).

    the rich text formatting. You do not need to learn Markdown to write text in the
    Markdown cells in Jupyter; plain text will work just fine. However, you might

- en: 'As you might know (or at least imagine) by now, Jupyter notebooks are great
    for interactively editing, writing and running R code; this is what they were
    designed for! Consequently, Jupyter notebooks are flexible in regards to code
    cell execution order. This flexibility means that code cells can be run in any
    arbitrary order using the **Run** (▶) button. But this flexibility has a downside:
    it can lead to Jupyter notebooks whose code cannot be executed in a linear order
    (from top to bottom of the notebook). A nonlinear notebook is problematic because
    a linear order is the conventional way code documents are run, and others will
    have this expectation when running your notebook. Finally, if the code is used
    in some automated process, it will need to run in a linear order, from top to
    bottom of the notebook.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common way to inadvertently create a nonlinear notebook is to rely
    solely on using the ▶ button to execute cells. For example, suppose you write
    some R code that creates an R object, say a variable named `y`. When you execute
    that cell and create `y`, it will continue to exist until it is deliberately deleted
    with R code, or when the Jupyter notebook R session (*i.e.*, kernel) is stopped
    or restarted. It can also be referenced in another distinct code cell (Figure
    [11.10](jupyter.html#fig:out-of-order-1)). Together, this means that you could
    then write a code cell further above in the notebook that references `y` and execute
    it without error in the current session (Figure [11.11](jupyter.html#fig:out-of-order-2)).
    This could also be done successfully in future sessions if, and only if, you run
    the cells in the same unconventional order. However, it is difficult to remember
    this unconventional order, and it is not the order that others would expect your
    code to be executed in. Thus, in the future, this would lead to errors when the
    notebook is run in the conventional linear order (Figure [11.12](jupyter.html#fig:out-of-order-3)).

    in a cell that later gets deleted. In such a scenario, that object only exists
    for that one particular R session and will not exist once the notebook is restarted
    and run again. If that object was referenced in another cell in that notebook,
    an error would occur when the notebook was run again in a new session.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    being written; but as you might now see, they will likely lead to errors when
    that notebook is run in a future session. Regularly executing the entire notebook
    in a fresh R session will help guard against this. If you restart your session
    and new errors seem to pop up when you run all of your cells in linear order,
    you can at least be aware that there is an issue. Knowing this sooner rather than
    later will allow you to fix the issue and ensure your notebook can be run linearly
    from start to finish.

- en: We recommend as a best practice to run the entire notebook in a fresh R session
    at least 2–3 times within any period of work. Note that, critically, you *must
    do this in a fresh R session* by restarting your kernel. We recommend using either
    the **Kernel** >> **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells…** command from the menu
    or the ⏭ button in the toolbar. Note that the **Run** >> **Run All Cells** menu
    item will not restart the kernel, and so it is not sufficient to guard against

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most data analyses these days depend on functions from external R packages that
    are not built into R. One example is the `tidyverse` metapackage that we heavily
    rely on in this book. This package provides us access to functions like `read_csv`
    for reading data, `select` for subsetting columns, and `ggplot` for creating high-quality
    graphics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned earlier in the book, external R packages need to be loaded before
    the functions they contain can be used. Our recommended way to do this is via
    `library(package_name)`. But where should this line of code be written in a Jupyter
    notebook? One idea could be to load the library right before the function is used
    in the notebook. However, although this technically works, this causes hidden,
    or at least non-obvious, R package dependencies when others view or try to run
    the notebook. These hidden dependencies can lead to errors when the notebook is
    executed on another computer if the needed R packages are not installed. Additionally,
    if the data analysis code takes a long time to run, uncovering the hidden dependencies
    that need to be installed so that the analysis can run without error can take
    a great deal of time to uncover.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we recommend you load all R packages in a code cell near the top
    of the Jupyter notebook. Loading all your packages at the start ensures that all
    packages are loaded before their functions are called, assuming the notebook is
    run in a linear order from top to bottom as recommended above. It also makes it
    easy for others viewing or running the notebook to see what external R packages
    are used in the analysis, and hence, what packages they should install on their
    computer to run the analysis successfully.

    text files (e.g., comma- and tab-separated files) in their plain text format (Figure
    [11.14](jupyter.html#fig:open-data-w-editor-2)) by right-clicking on the file’s
    name in the Jupyter file explorer, selecting **Open with**, and then selecting
    **Editor** (Figure [11.13](jupyter.html#fig:open-data-w-editor-1)). Suppose you
    do not specify to open the data file with an editor. In that case, Jupyter will
    render a nice table for you, and you will not be able to see the column delimiters,
    and therefore you will not know which function to use, nor which arguments to
    use and values to specify for them.

    as a more common file type, such as an `.html` file, or a `.pdf`. We recommend
    exporting the Jupyter notebook after executing the analysis so that you can also
    share the outputs of your code. Note, however, that your audience will not be
    able to *run* your analysis using a `.html` or `.pdf` file. If you want your audience

    notebook included references to image files. Unfortunately, the default settings
    will result in a document that visually looks quite different from what the Jupyter
    notebook looked like. The font, page margins, and other details will appear different
    in the `.pdf` output.

- en: At some point, you will want to create a new, fresh Jupyter notebook for your
    own project instead of viewing, running or editing a notebook that was started
    by someone else. To do this, navigate to the **Launcher** tab, and click on the
    R icon under the **Notebook** heading. If no **Launcher** tab is visible, you
    can get a new one via clicking the **+** button at the top of the Jupyter file
    explorer (Figure [11.15](jupyter.html#fig:launcher)).

- en: Once you have created a new Jupyter notebook, be sure to give it a descriptive
    name, as the default file name is `Untitled.ipynb`. You can rename files by first
    right-clicking on the file name of the notebook you just created, and then clicking
    **Rename**. This will make the file name editable. Use your keyboard to change
    the name. Pressing `Enter` or clicking anywhere else in the Jupyter interface
    will save the changed file name.

- en: We recommend not using white space or non-standard characters in file names.
    Doing so will not prevent you from using that file in Jupyter. However, these
    sorts of things become troublesome as you start to do more advanced data science
    projects that involve repetition and automation. We recommend naming files using
    lower case characters and separating words by a dash (`-`) or an underscore (`_`).

- en: The [JupyterLab Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    is a good next place to look for more information about working in Jupyter notebooks.
    This documentation goes into significantly more detail about all of the topics
    we covered in this chapter, and covers more advanced topics as well.
