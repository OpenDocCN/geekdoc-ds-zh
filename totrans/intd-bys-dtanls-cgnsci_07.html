<p>Before we can start analyzing realistic data sets using Bayes’ rule, it is important to understand the application of Bayes’ rule in one of the simplest of cases, data involving the binomial likelihood. This simple case is important to understand because it encapsulates the essence of the Bayesian approach to data analysis, and because it allows us to analytically work out the posterior distribution of the parameter of interest, using just pen and paper. This simple case also helps us to appreciate a crucial point: The posterior distribution of a parameter is a compromise between the prior and the likelihood. This important insight will play a central role in the realistic data analysis situations we will cover in the remainder of this book.</p>
<div id="bayes-rule" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span>  Bayes’ rule<a href="ch-introBDA.html#bayes-rule" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>Recall Bayes’ rule: When <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are observable discrete events (such as “it has been raining” or “the streets are wet”), we can state the rule as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:bayes-P">\[\begin{equation}
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Given a vector of data <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{y}\)</span>, Bayes’ rule allows us to work out the posterior distributions of the parameters of interest, which we can represent as the vector of parameters <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}\)</span>. This computation is achieved by rewriting Equation <a href="ch-introBDA.html#eq:bayes-P">(2.1)</a> as <a href="ch-introBDA.html#eq:bayes">(2.2)</a>. What is different here is that Bayes’ rule is written in terms of probability distributions. Here, <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot)\)</span> is a probability density function (continuous case) or a probability mass function (discrete case).</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:bayes">\[\begin{equation}
p(\boldsymbol{\Theta}|\boldsymbol{y}) = \cfrac{ p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{\Theta}) \times p(\boldsymbol{\Theta}) }{p(\boldsymbol{y})}
\tag{2.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The above statement can be rewritten in words as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\hbox{Posterior} = \frac{\hbox{Likelihood} \times \hbox{Prior}}{\hbox{Marginal Likelihood}}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The terms here have the following meaning. We elaborate on each point with an example below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>Posterior</em>, <span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol{\Theta}|\boldsymbol{y})\)</span>, is the probability distribution of the parameters conditional on the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Likelihood</em>, <span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{\Theta}\)</span>) is as described in chapter <a href="ch-intro.html#ch-intro">1</a>: it is the PMF (discrete case) or the PDF (continuous case) expressed as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Prior</em>, <span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol{\Theta})\)</span>, is the initial probability distribution of the parameter(s), before seeing the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Marginal Likelihood</em>, <span class="math inline">\(p(\boldsymbol{y})\)</span>, was introduced in chapter <a href="ch-intro.html#ch-intro">1</a> and standardizes the posterior distribution to ensure that the  area under the curve of the distribution sums to 1, that is, it ensures that the posterior is a valid probability distribution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An example will clarify all these terms.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Deriving the  posterior using Bayes’ rule: An analytical example<a href="ch-introBDA.html#sec-analytical" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>Recall our cloze probability example earlier. Subjects are shown sentences like</p>
<p>“It’s raining. I’m going to take the …”</p>
<p>Suppose that 100 subjects are asked to complete the sentence.
If <span class="math inline">\(80\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> subjects complete the sentence with “umbrella,” the estimated cloze probability or predictability (given the preceding context) would be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{80}{100}=0.8\)</span>. This is the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of producing this word; we will designate the estimate with a “hat” on the parameter name: <span class="math inline">\(\hat \theta=0.8\)</span>. In the frequentist paradigm, <span class="math inline">\(\hat \theta=0.8\)</span> is an estimate of an unknown point value <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> “out there in nature.”</p>
<p>A crucial point to notice here is that the proportion <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span> that we estimated above from the data can vary from one data set to another, and the variability in the estimate will be influenced by the sample size (the number of trials). For example, assuming that the true value of the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> parameter is in fact <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span>, if we repeatedly carry out the above experiment with say <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> trials, we will get some variability in the estimated proportion. Let’s check this by carrying out <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> simulated experiments and computing the variability of the estimated means under repeated sampling:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb78"><pre class="sourceCode r fold-show"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb78-1"><a href="ch-introBDA.html#cb78-1" aria-hidden="true"/>estimated_means &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rbinom</span>(<span class="dv">100</span>, <span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">prob =</span> <span class="fl">0.8</span>) <span class="op">/</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">10</span></span>
<span id="cb78-2"><a href="ch-introBDA.html#cb78-2" aria-hidden="true"/><span class="kw">sd</span>(estimated_means)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.118</code></pre>
<p>The repeated runs of the (simulated) experiment are the sole underlying cause for the variability (shown by the output of the <code>sd(estimated)</code> command above) in the estimated proportion; the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0.80\)</span> itself is invariant here (we are repeatedly estimating this point value).</p>
<p>However, consider now an alternative, radical idea: what if we treat <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as a random variable? That is, suppose now that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> has a PDF associated with it. This PDF would now represent our belief about possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, even before we have seen any data. For example, if at the outset of the experiment, we believe that all possible values between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> are equally likely, we could represent that belief by stating that <span class="math inline">\(\theta \sim \mathit{Uniform}(0,1)\)</span>. The radical new idea here is that we now have a way to represent our prior belief or knowledge about plausible values of the parameter.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to run our simulated experiments again and again, there would be <em>two</em> sources of variability in the estimate of the parameter: the data as well as the uncertainty associated with <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>

<p>The higher standard deviation is now coming from the uncertainty associated with the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> parameter. To see this, assume a “tighter” PDF for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(\theta \sim \mathit{Uniform}(0.3,0.8)\)</span>, then the variability in the estimated means would again be smaller, but not as small as when we assumed that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> was a point value:</p>

<p>In other words, the greater the uncertainty associated with the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, the greater the variability in the data.</p>
<p>The Bayesian approach to parameter estimation makes a radical departure from the standard frequentist assumption, which assumes that the true, unknown value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is some point value. In the Bayesian approach, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a random variable with a probability density/mass function associated with it. This PDF is called a prior distribution, and represents our prior belief or prior knowledge about possible values of this parameter. Once we obtain data, these data serve to modify our prior belief about this distribution; this updated probability density function of the parameter is called the posterior distribution. These ideas are unpacked in the sections below.</p>
<div id="choosing-a-likelihood" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Choosing a  likelihood<a href="ch-introBDA.html#choosing-a-likelihood" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>Under the assumptions we have set up above, the responses follow a binomial distribution, and so the PMF can be written as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:binom">\[\begin{equation}
p(k|n,\theta) = \binom{n}
{k} \theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k}
\tag{2.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> indicates the number of times “umbrella” is given as an answer, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of trials. In our running example, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> can therefore be any whole number going from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>.</p>
<p>In a particular experiment that we carry out, if we collect <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> data points (<span class="math inline">\(n=100\)</span>) and it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(k = 80\)</span>, these data are now a fixed quantity. The only variable now in the PMF above is <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(k=80 | n= 100,  \theta) = \binom{100}{80} \theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The above function is a now a continuous function of the value <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, which has possible values ranging from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Compare this to the PMF of the binomial, which treats <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as a fixed value and defines a discrete distribution over the <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> possible discrete values <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that we can observe (the possible number of successes).</p>
<p>Recall that the  PMF and the  likelihood are the same function seen from different points of view. The only difference between the two is what is considered to be fixed and what is varying. The PMF treats data as varying from experiment to experiment and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as fixed, whereas the likelihood function treats the data that have been collected as fixed and the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as varying.</p>
<p>We now turn our attention back to our main goal, which is to find out, using Bayes’ rule, the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> given our data: <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|n,k)\)</span>. In order to use Bayes’ rule to calculate this posterior distribution, we need to define a prior distribution over the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. In doing so, we are explicitly expressing our prior uncertainty about plausible values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Choosing a  prior for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span><a href="ch-introBDA.html#sec-choosepriortheta" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>For the choice of prior for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the binomial distribution, we need to assume that the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a random variable that has a PDF whose range lies within [0,1], the range over which <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> can vary (this is because <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> represents a probability). The  beta distribution, which is a PDF for a continuous random variable, is commonly used as prior for parameters representing probabilities. One reason for this choice is that its PDF ranges over the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. The other reason for this choice is that it makes the Bayes’ rule calculation remarkably easy.</p>
<p>The beta distribution has the following PDF.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:betach2">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta|a,b)=  \frac{1}{B(a,b)} \theta^{a - 1} (1-\theta)^{b-1}
\tag{2.4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The term <span class="math inline">\(B(a,b)\)</span> expands to <span class="math inline">\(\int_0^1 \theta^{a-1}(1-\theta)^{b-1}\, \mathrm{d}\theta\)</span>, and is a normalizing constant that ensures that the  area under the curve sums to one. In some textbooks, you may see the PDF of the beta distribution with the normalizing constant <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}\)</span> (the expression <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(n)\)</span> is defined as (n-1)!): <span class="math display">\[p(\theta|a,b)=  \frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)} \theta^{a - 1} (1-\theta)^{b-1}\]</span> These two statements for the beta distribution are identical because <span class="math inline">\(B(a,b)\)</span> can be shown to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}\)</span> <span class="citation">(Ross <a href="#ref-RossProb" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The beta distribution’s parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be interpreted as expressing our prior beliefs about the probability of success; <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> represents the number of “successes”, in our case, answers that are “umbrella” and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the number of failures, the answers that are not “umbrella.” Figure <a href="ch-introBDA.html#fig:betas2">2.1</a> shows the different beta distribution shapes given different values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>

FIGURE 2.1: Examples of beta distributions with different parameters.
</p>
</div>
<p>As in the binomial and normal distributions that we saw in chapter 1, one can analytically derive the formulas for the expectation and variance of the beta distribution. These are:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:meanvar">\[\begin{equation}
\operatorname{E}[X] = \frac{a}{a+b} \quad \operatorname{Var}(X)=\frac {a \times b }{(a + b )^{2}(a + b +1)}
\tag{2.5}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>As an example, choosing <span class="math inline">\(a=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b=4\)</span> would mean that the answer “umbrella” is as likely as a different answer, but we are relatively unsure about this. We could express our uncertainty by computing the region over which we are 95% certain that the value of the parameter lies; this is the  <em>95% credible interval</em>. For this, we would use the <code>qbeta()</code> function in R; the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are called <code>shape1</code> and <code>shape2</code> in R.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb84"><pre class="sourceCode r fold-show"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb84-1"><a href="ch-introBDA.html#cb84-1" aria-hidden="true"/><span class="kw">qbeta</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="fl">0.025</span>, <span class="fl">0.975</span>), <span class="dt">shape1 =</span> <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dt">shape2 =</span> <span class="dv">4</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.184 0.816</code></pre>
<p>The credible interval chosen above is an equal-tailed interval: the area below the lower bound and above the upper bound is the same (<span class="math inline">\(0.025\)</span> in the above case). One could define alternative intervals; for example, in a distribution with only one mode (one peak; a unimodal distribution), one could choose to use the narrowest interval that contains the mode. This is called the  highest posterior density interval (HDI). In skewed posterior distributions, the equal-tailed credible interval and the HDI will not be identical, because the HDI will have unequal tail probabilities. Some authors, such as <span class="citation">Kruschke (<a href="#ref-kruschke2014doing" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, prefer to report the HDI. We will use the equal-tailed interval in this book, simply because this is the standard output in Stan and <code>brms</code>.</p>
<p>If we were to choose <span class="math inline">\(a=10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b=10\)</span>, we would still be assuming that a priori the answer “umbrella” is just as likely as some other answer, but now our prior uncertainty about this mean is lower, as the 95% credible interval computed below shows.</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="ch-introBDA.html#fig:betas2">2.1</a>, we can see also the difference in uncertainty in these two examples graphically.</p>
<p>Which prior should we choose? In a real data analysis problem, the choice of prior would depend on what prior knowledge we want to bring into the analysis (see the online chapter <a href="ch-priors.html#ch-priors">E</a>). If we don’t have much prior information, we could use <span class="math inline">\(a=b=1\)</span>; this gives us a uniform prior (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Uniform}(0,1)\)</span>). This kind of prior goes by various names, such as <em>flat, non-informative prior</em>, or  <em>uninformative prior</em>. By contrast, if we have a lot of prior knowledge and/or a strong belief (e.g., based on a particular theory’s predictions, or prior data) that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> has a particular range of plausible values, we can use a different set of <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span> values to reflect our belief about the parameter. Generally speaking, the larger the values of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the narrower the spread of the distribution; i.e., the lower our uncertainty about the mean value of the parameter.</p>
<p>We will discuss prior specification in detail in the online chapter <a href="ch-priors.html#ch-priors">E</a>. For the moment, just for illustration, we choose the values <span class="math inline">\(a=4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b=4\)</span> for the beta prior. Then, our prior for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the following beta PDF:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta) = \frac{1}{B(4,4)} \theta^{3} (1-\theta)^{3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Having chosen a likelihood, and having defined a prior on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, we are ready to carry out our first Bayesian analysis to derive a posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Using  Bayes’ rule to compute the  posterior <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|n,k)\)</span><a href="ch-introBDA.html#using-bayes-rule-to-compute-the-posterior-pthetank" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>Having specified the likelihood and the prior, we will now use Bayes’ rule to calculate <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|n,k)\)</span>. Using Bayes’ rule simply involves replacing the likelihood and the prior we defined above into the equation we saw earlier:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\hbox{Posterior} = \frac{\hbox{Likelihood} \times  \hbox{Prior}}{\hbox{Marginal Likelihood}}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Replace the terms for likelihood and prior into this equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:betaunpost">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta|n=100,k=80) = \frac{\left[\binom{100}{80} \theta^{80} \times  (1-\theta)^{20}\right]  \times \left[\frac{1}{B(4,4)} \times \theta^{3} (1-\theta)^{3}\right]}{p(k=80)}
\tag{2.6}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p(k=80)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^1 p(k=80|n=100,\theta) p(\theta)\, \mathrm{d}\theta\)</span>. This term will be a constant once the number of successes <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is known; this is the marginal likelihood we encountered in chapter 1. In fact, once <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is known, there are several constant values in the above equation; they are constants because none of them depend on the parameter of interest, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. We can collect all of these together:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:betaunpost2">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta|n=100,k=80) =   \left[ \frac{\binom{100}{80}}{B(4,4)\times p(k=80)} \right]   [\theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20} \times  \theta^{3} (1-\theta)^{3}]
\tag{2.7}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The first term that is in square brackets, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\binom{100}{80}}{B(4,4)\times p(k=80)}\)</span>, is all the constants collected together, and is the normalizing constant we have seen before; it makes the posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|n=100,k=80)\)</span> sum to one. Since it is a constant, we can ignore it for now and focus on the two other terms in the equation. Because we are ignoring the constant, we will now say that the posterior is proportional to the right-hand side.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:betaunpost3">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta|n=100,k=80) \propto   [\theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20} \times \theta^{3} (1-\theta)^{3} ]
\tag{2.8}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>A common way of writing the above equation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\hbox{Posterior} \propto \hbox{Likelihood} \times \hbox{Prior}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Resolving the right-hand side now simply involves adding up the exponents! In this example, computing the posterior really does boil down to this simple addition operation on the exponents.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:betaunpost4">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta|n=100,k=80) \propto   [\theta^{80+3} (1-\theta)^{20+3}] = \theta^{83} (1-\theta)^{23}
\tag{2.9}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The expression on the right-hand side corresponds to a beta distribution with parameters <span class="math inline">\(a=84\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b=24\)</span>. This becomes evident if we rewrite the right-hand side such that it represents the core part of a beta PDF (see equation <a href="ch-introBDA.html#eq:betach2">(2.4)</a>). All that is missing is a normalizing constant which would make the  area under the curve sum to one.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\theta^{83} (1-\theta)^{23} = \theta^{84-1} (1-\theta)^{24-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This core part of any PDF or PMF is called the  kernel of that distribution. Without a normalizing constant, the  area under the curve will not sum to one. Let’s check this:</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 1.42e-26</code></pre>
<p>So the area under the curve (AUC) is not <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>—the posterior that we computed above is not a proper probability distribution. What we have just done above is to compute the following integral:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{1} \theta^{84} (1-\theta)^{24}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>We can use this integral to figure out what the normalizing constant is. Basically, we want to know what the constant k is such that the area under the curve sums to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
k \int_{0}^{1} \theta^{84} (1-\theta)^{24} = 1
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>We know what <span class="math inline">\(\int_{0}^{1} \theta^{84} (1-\theta)^{24}\)</span> is; we just computed that value (called <code>AUC</code> in the R code above). So, the  normalizing constant is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
k  = \frac{1}{\int_{0}^{1} \theta^{84} (1-\theta)^{24}} = \frac{1}{AUC}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>So, all that is needed to make the kernel <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{84} (1-\theta)^{24}\)</span> into a proper probability distribution is to include a normalizing constant, which, according to the definition of the beta distribution (equation <a href="ch-introBDA.html#eq:betach2">(2.4)</a>), would be <span class="math inline">\(B(84,24)\)</span>. This term is in fact the integral we computed above.</p>
<p>So, what we have is the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> given the data, expressed as a PDF:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta|n=100,k=80) = \frac{1}{B(84,24)} \theta^{84-1} (1-\theta)^{24-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, this function will sum to one:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Summary of the procedure<a href="ch-introBDA.html#summary-of-the-procedure" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p>To summarize, we started with data (<span class="math inline">\(n=100, k=80\)</span>) and a binomial likelihood, multiplied it with the prior probability density function <span class="math inline">\(\theta \sim \mathit{Beta}(4,4)\)</span>, and obtained the posterior <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|n,k) \sim \mathit{Beta}(84,24)\)</span>. The constants were ignored when carrying out the multiplication; we say that we computed the posterior <em>up to proportionality</em>. Finally, we showed how, in this simple example, the posterior can be rescaled to become a probability distribution, by including a proportionality constant.</p>
<p>The above example is a case of a  <em>conjugate</em> analysis: the posterior on the parameter has the same form (belongs to the same family of probability distributions) as the prior. The above combination of likelihood and prior is called the  beta-binomial conjugate case. There are several other such combinations of Likelihoods and Priors that yield a posterior that has a PDF that belongs to the same family as the PDF on the prior; some examples will appear in the exercises.</p>
<p>Formally, conjugacy is defined as follows: Given the likelihood <span class="math inline">\(p(y| \theta)\)</span>, if the prior <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta)\)</span> results in a posterior <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|y)\)</span> that has the same form as <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta)\)</span>, then we call <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta)\)</span> a  conjugate prior.</p>
<p>For the beta-binomial conjugate case, we can derive a very general relationship between the likelihood, prior, and posterior. Given the binomial likelihood up to proportionality (ignoring the constant) <span class="math inline">\(\theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k}\)</span>, and given the prior, also up to proportionality, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{a-1} (1-\theta)^{b-1}\)</span>, their product will be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\theta^k (1-\theta)^{n-k} \theta^{a-1} (1-\theta)^{b-1} = \theta^{a+k-1} (1-\theta)^{b+n-k-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, given a <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Binomial}(n,k|\theta)\)</span> likelihood, and a <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a,b)\)</span> prior on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, the posterior will be <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a+k,b+n-k)\)</span>.</p>

<p>We can summarize the posterior distribution either graphically as we did above, or summarize it by computing the mean and the variance. The mean gives us an estimate of the cloze probability of producing “umbrella” in that sentence (given the model, i.e., given the likelihood and prior):</p>

<p>Recall from the preceding sections that the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> parameters in the beta distribution determine the shape of the prior distribution on the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> parameter. Just for the sake of illustration, let’s take four different beta priors, which reflect increasing prior certainty about <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a=2,b=2)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a=3,b=3)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a=6,b=6)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a=21,b=21)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these priors reflects a belief that <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0.5\)</span>, but with varying degrees of (un)certainty. Given the general formula we developed above for the beta-binomial case, we just need to plug in the likelihood and the prior to get the posterior:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta | n,k) \propto p(k |n,\theta) p(\theta)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The four corresponding posterior distributions would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta\mid k,n) \propto [\theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20}] [\theta^{2-1}(1-\theta)^{2-1}] = \theta^{82-1} (1-\theta)^{22-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta\mid k,n) \propto [\theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20}] [\theta^{3-1}(1-\theta)^{3-1}] = \theta^{83-1} (1-\theta)^{23-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta\mid k,n) \propto [\theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20}] [\theta^{6-1}(1-\theta)^{6-1}] = \theta^{86-1} (1-\theta)^{26-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
p(\theta\mid k,n) \propto [\theta^{80} (1-\theta)^{20}] [\theta^{21-1}(1-\theta)^{21-1}] = \theta^{101-1} (1-\theta)^{41-1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>We can visualize each of these triplets of priors, likelihoods and posteriors; see Figure <a href="ch-introBDA.html#fig:postbetavizvar">2.3</a>.</p>

<p>Given some data and given a likelihood function, the tighter the prior, the greater the extent to which the posterior orients itself towards the prior. In general, we can say the following about the likelihood-prior-posterior relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>The posterior distribution of a parameter is a compromise between the prior and the likelihood.</li>
<li>For a given set of data, the greater the certainty in the prior, the more heavily will the posterior be influenced by the prior mean.</li>
<li>Conversely, for a given set of data, the greater the <em>un</em>certainty in the prior, the more heavily will the posterior be influenced by the likelihood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important observation emerges if we increase the sample size (here, the number of trials) from <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> to, say, <span class="math inline">\(1000000\)</span>. Suppose we still get a sample mean of <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span> here, so that <span class="math inline">\(k=800000\)</span>. Now, the posterior mean will be influenced almost entirely by the sample mean. This is because, in the general form for the posterior <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a+k,b+n-k)\)</span> that we computed above, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> become very large relative to the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> values, and dominate in determining the posterior mean.</p>
<p>Whenever we do a Bayesian analysis, it is good practice to check whether the parameter you are interested in estimating is sensitive to the prior specification. Such an investigation is called a  <em>sensitivity analysis</em>. Later in this book, we will see many examples of sensitivity analyses in realistic data-analysis settings.</p>

<p>In the above example, we used an artificial example where we asked <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> subjects to complete the sentence shown at the beginning of the chapter, and then we counted the number of times that they produced “umbrella” vs. some other word as a continuation. Given <span class="math inline">\(80\)</span> instances of “umbrella”, and using a <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(4,4)\)</span> prior, we derived the posterior to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(84,24)\)</span>. We could now use this posterior as our prior for the next study. Suppose that we were to carry out a second experiment, again with <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> subjects, and this time <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> produced “umbrella.” We could now use our new prior (<span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(84,24)\)</span>) to obtain an updated posterior. We have <span class="math inline">\(a=84, b=24, n=100, k=60\)</span>. This gives us as posterior:
<span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(a+k,b+n-k) = \mathit{Beta}(84+60,24+100-60)=\mathit{Beta}(144,64)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to pool all our data that we have from the two experiments, then we would have as data <span class="math inline">\(n=200, k=140\)</span>. Suppose that we keep our initial prior of <span class="math inline">\(a=4,b=4\)</span>. Then, our posterior would be <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{Beta}(4+140,4+200-140)=\mathit{Beta}(144,64)\)</span>. This is exactly the same posterior that we got when first analyzed the first <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> subjects’ data, derived the posterior, and then used that posterior as a prior for the next <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> subjects’ data.</p>
<p>This toy example illustrates an important point that has great practical importance for cognitive science. One can incrementally gain information about a research question by using information from previous studies and deriving a posterior, and then use that posterior as a prior for the next study. For practical examples from psycholinguistics showing how information can be pooled from previous studies, see <span class="citation">Jäger, Engelmann, and Vasishth (<a href="#ref-JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Nicenboim, Roettger, and Vasishth (<a href="#ref-NicenboimRoettgeretal" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Vasishth and Engelmann (<a href="#ref-VasishthEngelmann2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> illustrates an example of how the posterior from a previous study or collection of studies can be used as a prior to compute the posterior from new data. This approach allows us to build on the information available from previous work.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned how to use Bayes’ rule in the specific case of a binomial likelihood, and a beta prior on the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> parameter in the likelihood function. Our goal in any Bayesian analysis will follow the path we took in this simple example: decide on an appropriate likelihood function, decide on priors for all the parameters involved in the likelihood function, and use this model (i.e., the likelihood and the priors) to derive the posterior distribution of each parameter. Then we draw inferences about our research question based on the posterior distribution of the parameter.</p>
<p>In the example discussed in this chapter, Bayesian analysis was easy. This was because we considered the simple conjugate case of the beta-binomial. In realistic data-analysis settings, our likelihood function will be very complex, and many parameters will be involved. Multiplying the likelihood function and the priors will become mathematically difficult or impossible. For such situations, we use computational methods to obtain samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters.</p>
