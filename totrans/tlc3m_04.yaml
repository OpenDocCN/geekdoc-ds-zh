- en: Before mathematics was written, it was lived. Long before parchment and ink,
    before the scholar’s desk or the scribe’s tablet, there was the shepherd - eyes
    scanning the hills, heart counting what the mind could not hold. His flock wandered
    across the horizon, each animal a moving thought. Memory faltered; vision deceived.
    So he reached to the earth, gathered stones, and laid them in a hollow - one pebble
    for each creature, one mark for each life. Thus number was born, not from curiosity,
    but from necessity; not in abstraction, but in care.

- en: This humble gesture - to let one thing stand for another - transformed the way
    the human mind met the world. The pebble was not the sheep, yet it preserved the

    stepped outside the skull. For the first time, memory could be stored in matter.
    Pebbles became proxies, shadows of reality cast in clay and stone.

  zh: 确定性的逻辑锻造了科学思维——一种要求证明而非教条的文化。通过证明，人类学会了权威可以*推导*，而不是宣布；真理可以通过结构本身来说服。
- en: From Euclid to Hilbert, Gödel to Turing, each milestone refined what it means
    to know. Proof became not merely a method but a mirror - revealing both the power
    and the limits of reason.

  zh: 从欧几里得到希尔伯特，从哥德尔到图灵，每个里程碑都细化了“知道”的含义。证明不再仅仅是方法，而是镜子——揭示理性的力量和局限。

    awe. Certainty remains our compass, even when the horizon recedes.
