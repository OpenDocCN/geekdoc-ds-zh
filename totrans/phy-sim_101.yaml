    nodes. Although this does not directly correspond to any physical effects, it
    can simplify the simulation setup.

- en: Therefore, to add a constant Neumann force to the discrete system, we first
    calculate the length weight of each boundary node by distributing the length of
    the boundary edges evenly to their vertices, and then multiply by the traction
    Ti^n​. If T is not constant over the boundary, more complex boundary integral
    calculations are needed. For a boundary node with only one incident triangle,
    its length weight comes from its two incident edges within the same triangle.

- en: '***Remark 20.1.1 (Neumann Boundary Conditions).*** Here, we observe that the
    specified traction in standard Neumann boundary conditions is independent of x,
    which simplifies the derivation of the potential energy, even in the continuous
    setting for varying Neumann forces over the domain: ∫ΓN​​x(X)⋅T(X,tn)ds(X).(20.1.1)
    To verify this, we can replace x(X) with x^(X)=Na^​(X)xa^​+… for spatial discretization.
    Taking the derivative with respect to xa^​ gives us the force integral term in
    the discrete weak form: ∂xa^​∂∫ΓN​​x^(X)⋅T(X,tn)ds(X)​=∫ΓN​​Na^​(X)T(X,tn)ds(X).'
