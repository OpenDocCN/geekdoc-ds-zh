<p>This section has demonstrated that, with a change in the basis of variables, general slip Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC) can be effectively managed using the Degree of Freedom (DOF) elimination method, much like axis-aligned slip DBCs.</p>
<p>While singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used to find the basis for general linear equality constraints, this approach may not be feasible for large or complex constraints. Nonetheless, it's possible to develop procedural routines for computing the basis, specifically tailored to node-wise slip DBC constraints.</p>
<p>Currently, our focus has been on maintaining DBCs that are already satisfied within the simulation framework. Moving forward, the discussion will shift towards exploring frictional contact between points and analytic surfaces. Additionally, we will revisit scenarios where DBCs are not satisfied at the start of a time step, delving into more complex cases.</p>
