- en: To accurately simulate solids, it's essential to ensure that they don't interpenetrate,
    as shown in the figure below (left side). One effective approach is to enforce
    the **CFL** (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition) upper limit on timestep sizes,
    particularly in methods like MPM. In Finite Element Methods (FEM), this requires
    precise modeling of contact forces. However, accurately modeling contact poses
    a challenge. Contact is inherently a non-smooth process, happening abruptly as
    solids make contact. There isn't a potential energy formulation that can accurately
    depict this phenomenon.

    an intriguing simulation shows four characters plunging into a funnel and then
    being extruded by a moving plane. The flawless execution, marked by the absence
    of any interpenetration during this complex interaction, highlights the precision
    of the models employed. On the right, we see a simulation of the classic table
    cloth trick, executed at varying speeds. The realism in this simulation, especially
    the accurate depiction of friction, becomes apparent as the cloth is pulled away
    without disturbing the table setting — mirroring what one would expect in real
    life. These simulations showcase the incredible capabilities and precision of
    contemporary computational models in simulating contact, vividly and engagingly
    bringing abstract physical concepts to life.'

    involves visually and mentally assessing their proximity. When the distance between
    them isn't zero, it indicates that space remains and no collision has occurred.
    This concept is crucial in modeling interactions between objects in a computational
    context.

    the surfaces of the moving objects never reduces to zero. This approach is particularly
    useful in time integration problems within computational simulations. We model
    this scenario using inequality constraints, which, when combined with boundary
    conditions, formulate our time integration problem as follows: xmin​E(x)s.t.Ax=b and ∀k, ck​(x)≥ϵ.​(2.3.1)
    Here, \(c_k\) measures the distance between specific pairs of regions on the surface
    of the solids, and \(\epsilon \rightarrow 0\) is a tiny positive value to ensure
    \(c_k(x)\) remains strictly positive.'

    primary focus will be on a robust and accurate contact modeling method, known
    as **Incremental Potential Contact (IPC)**. IPC distinguishes itself by approximating
    the contact process with a smooth potential energy. This transformation effectively
    turns the problem into an unconstrained one, facilitating the application of various
    efficient and robust optimization techniques. A key feature of IPC is its capability
    to control the approximation error relative to the non-smooth formulation within
    a predetermined bound. This characteristic adds a layer of robustness and reliability
    to the method, making it an especially promising approach for the problem at hand.
