    difference approximation. In this approximation, the derivative \((\frac{\mathbf{d}
    x}{\mathbf{d} t})^n\) is estimated as \(\frac{x^{n+1} - x^n}{\Delta t}\), and
    likewise, \((\frac{\mathbf{d} v}{\mathbf{d} t})^n\) as \(\frac{v^{n+1} - v^n}{\Delta
    t}\). The superscript \(n\) represents the state variables at the \(n\)th timestep.
    Consequently, the discrete version of our system is expressed as: Δtxn+1−xn​MΔtvn+1−vn​​=vn,=fn.​(1.4.1)
    Assuming a constant mass over time, these equations provide a clear mechanism
    to update our state variables. Knowing the current values \(x^n\), \(v^n\), and
    \(f^n\) at timestep \(n\), we can directly determine their values at the next
    timestep, \(n+1\).'

    In the Forward Euler method, the state variables \(x^{n+1}\) and \(v^{n+1}\) at
    the next time step \(n+1\) are calculated based on the current values \(x^n\)
    and \(v^n\). The update rules are given by: xn+1vn+1​=xn+Δtvn,=vn+ΔtM−1fn.​(1.4.2)
    Here, \(\Delta t\) represents the time step size, \(M\) is the mass matrix, and
    \(f^n\) is the force at the current time step \(n\).'

    that irrespective of the chosen small time step \(\Delta t\), the numerical solution
    will eventually grow significantly (*explode*) for equations with nonconstant
    \(f\), while the exact solution remains unaffected (refer to [Figure 1.4.1](#fig:lec1:time_integrators),

    implies that if \(\Delta t\) remains within a problem-specific limit, we can effectively
    confine the numerical error of the solution. Moreover, the Symplectic Euler method
    exhibits an appealing trait of system energy preservation, as demonstrated in
    the middle of the figure below.

    showcases a particle executing constant circular motion, simulated using the forward
    Euler, Symplectic Euler, and implicit Euler methods, respectively from left to
    right. The varying colors within the illustration represent the progression of

    the forward Euler simulation eventually undergoes an unstable escalation, the
    Symplectic Euler closely adheres to the theoretical trajectory, and the implicit
    Euler, while maintaining stability, gradually brings the motion to a halt.'
