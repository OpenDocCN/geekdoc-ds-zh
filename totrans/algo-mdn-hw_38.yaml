- en: In 1940, a British mathematician [G. H. Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy)
    published a famous essay titled “[A Mathematician’s Apology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology)”
    discussing the notion that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather
    than for the sake of its applications.

    spectrum, with mathematical logic and computability theory on one end and web
    programming and application development on the other. I assume that you, the reader,
    is more on the applied side: this book was written to show that there are way
    too few people working on practical algorithm design instead of theoretical computer
    science — and since you got to Chapter 7, you probably also believe in that statement.'

    is coming from. Being 62 years old at the date of writing, he witnessed the devastation
    caused by the First and the ongoing Second World War — which was greatly amplified
    by the weaponization of science. As a number theorist, Hardy finds calm working
    in a “useless” field and not having to face any moral dilemmas, writing:'

    numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.

    development of the atomic bomb, which would not have been possible without the
    [understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter)
    of relativity, and the inception of computer-era cryptography, which extensively
    builds on number theory — the computational aspect of which is the main topic
    of this chapter.
