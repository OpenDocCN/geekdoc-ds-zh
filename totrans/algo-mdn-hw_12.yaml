    concurrently, but also creates some potential obstacles of its own — characteristically
    called *pipeline hazards*, that is, situations when the next instruction cannot
    execute on the following clock cycle.'

- en: 'The only way to resolve a hazard is to have a *pipeline stall*: stop the progress
    of all previous steps until the cause of congestion is gone. This creates *bubbles*
    in the pipeline — analogous with air bubbles in fluid pipes — a time-propagating
    condition when execution units are idling and no useful work is done.'

- en: In structural hazards, you have to wait (usually one more cycle) until the execution
    unit is ready. They are fundamental bottlenecks on performance and can’t be avoided
    — you have to engineer around them.

- en: In data hazards, you have to wait for the required data to be computed (the
    latency of the *critical path*). Data hazards are solved by restructuring computations
    so that the critical path is shorter.

- en: In control hazards, you generally have to flush the entire pipeline and start
    over, wasting a whole 15-20 cycles. They are solved by either removing branches
    completely, or making them predictable so that the CPU can effectively *speculate*
    on what is going to be executed next.

    reversed order and start with the more grave ones.
