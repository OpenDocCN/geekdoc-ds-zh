- en: In this chapter, we look at network data. We begin by defining basic graph concepts.
    We then introduce ideas from spectral graph theory, in particular the eigenvalues
    of the Laplacian and their variational characterization. We discuss and implement
    some applications, including community detection. Here is a more detailed overview
    of the main sections of the chapter.

- en: '*“Background: basic concepts in graph theory”* This section provides an introduction
    to the basic concepts of graph theory, covering both undirected and directed graphs.
    It introduces key definitions such as vertices, edges, paths, connectivity, and
    various special types of graphs like cliques, trees, and directed acyclic graphs.
    The section also discusses different matrix representations. It discusses the
    Laplacian matrix, emphasizing its role in understanding graph connectivity. Finally,
    the section underscores the practical use of these concepts with the NetworkX
    Python package for graph manipulation and visualization.'

- en: '*“Variational characterization of eigenvalues”* This section explores a variational
    characterization of eigenvalues, offering a different perspective on understanding
    these important mathematical objects. It begins by presenting a proof of the spectral
    theorem, showcasing how orthogonal transformations can be employed to diagonalize
    a symmetric matrix. This proof serves as a foundation for the subsequent exploration
    of variational characterizations, which involve expressing eigenvalues as solutions
    to optimization problems. The section details specific cases, demonstrating how
    the largest and smallest eigenvalues can be determined through optimization procedures
    involving the Rayleigh quotient. Finally, it presents the Courant-Fischer theorem.'

- en: '*“Spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix”* The section discusses the spectral
    properties of the Laplacian matrix of a graph. It begins by observing that the
    Laplacian matrix is symmetric and positive semidefinite, and that the constant
    unit vector is always an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0\. The section then explores
    the connection between the Laplacian matrix and graph connectivity, proving that
    a graph is connected if and only if the second smallest eigenvalue (i.e., the
    algebraic connectivity) is strictly positive. Finally, the section presents a
    variational characterization of the second smallest eigenvalue, which minimizes
    the sum of squared differences of values assigned to adjacent vertices, subject
    to a centering and normalization constraint. This characterization is used to
    explain why eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix are useful for graph drawing
    and revealing the underlying geometry of the graph.'

- en: '*“Application: graph partitioning via spectral clustering”* This section explores
    graph partitioning, the division of a graph into two sets of nodes with minimal
    connections between them. It introduces a measure of a cut’s quality, balancing
    the minimization of edges between sets against the need for balanced set sizes,
    as well as the related concept of the isoperimetric number (or Cheeger constant)
    of a graph. The Cheeger’s Inequalities are presented, linking the isoperimetric
    number to the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue, demonstrating the relationship
    between spectral graph theory and graph partitioning. The section outlines a graph-cutting
    algorithm leveraging Laplacian eigenvectors, offering a heuristic approach to
    find good cuts with provable guarantees, and discusses the computational challenges
    of finding optimal cuts. It concludes by revisiting community detection, applying
    spectral properties to identify sub-communities within a graph.'

- en: '*“Erdős-Rényi random graph and stochastic blockmodel”* This section discusses
    random graph models, focusing on the inhomogeneous Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graph
    and the stochastic blockmodel (SBM). The inhomogeneous ER random graph is a versatile
    model for generating random graphs, where each edge is included independently
    with a specified probability. A special case is the ER random graph, where all
    edges between distinct vertices have the same probability of being present. The
    SBM extends this concept by partitioning vertices into blocks and assigning different
    probabilities for connections within and between blocks, enabling to capture in
    particular the tendency of nodes within the same group to connect more frequently.'
