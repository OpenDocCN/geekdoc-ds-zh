- en: Based on the temporally and spatially discretized weak form, we've explored
    methods to compute the mass matrix, deformation gradient, and elasticity force
    under the linear finite element setting, all of which align with our implementation
    in Section [Inversion-Free Elasticity](./lec15-inv_free_elasticity.html).

- en: With linear finite elements, the world space coordinates x are approximated
    as a piecewise linear function of X. This approximation, x^(X), is a linear function
    inside each triangle and is C0-continuous at the edges. By using two parameters,
    β and γ, to represent points on each triangle, we can identify the linear shape
    functions that interpolate the displacements at the triangle vertices and derive
    the deformation gradient F. The mass matrix entries and elasticity terms can then
    be computed via integration with respect to β and γ.
