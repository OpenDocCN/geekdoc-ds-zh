There are some things that are <em>under-defined</em>, like the order of keys in a hash table or the growth factor of an <code>std::vector</code>, but these are usually some minor details that are left up to implementation for potential performance gains in the future.</p><p>In contrast, C and C++ take the concept of undefined behavior to another level. Certain operations don’t cause an error during compilation or runtime but are just not <em>allowed</em> — in the sense of there being a <em>contract</em> between the programmer and the compiler, that in case of undefined behavior, the compiler is legally allowed to do literally anything, including blowing up your monitor or formatting your hard drive. But compiler engineers are not interested in doing that. Instead, undefined behavior is used to guarantee a lack of corner cases and help optimization.</p><span class="anchor" id="why-undefined-behavior-exists"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/contracts/#why-undefined-behavior-exists">#</a>Why Undefined Behavior Exists</h3><p>There are two major groups of actions that cause undefined behavior:</p><ul><li><p>Operations that are almost certainly unintentional bugs, like dividing by zero, dereferencing a null pointer, or reading from uninitialized memory. You want to catch these as soon as possible during testing, so crashing or having some non-deterministic behavior is better than having them always do a fixed fallback action such as returning zero.</p><p>You can compile and run a program with <em>sanitizers</em> to catch undefined behavior early. In GCC and Clang, you can use the <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code> flag, and some operations that are notorious for causing UB will be instrumented to detect it at runtime.</p></li><li><p>Operations that have slightly different observable behavior on different platforms. For example, the result of left-shifting an integer by more than 31 bits is undefined, because the instruction that does it is implemented differently on Arm and x86 CPUs. If you standardize one specific behavior, then all programs compiled for the other platform will have to spend a few more cycles checking for that edge case, so it is best to leave it undefined.</p><p>Sometimes, when there is a legitimate use case for some platform-specific behavior, instead of declaring it undefined, it can be left <em>implementation-defined</em>. For example, the result of right-shifting a <a href="/hpc/arithmetic/integer">negative integer</a> depends on the platform: it either shifts in zeros or ones (e.g., right-shifting <code>11010110 = -42</code> by one may mean either <code>01101011 = 107</code> or <code>11101011 = -21</code>, both use cases being realistic).</p></li></ul><p>Designating something as undefined instead of implementation-defined behavior also helps compilers in optimization. Consider the case of signed integer overflow. On almost all architectures, <a href="/hpc/arithmetic/integer">signed integers</a> overflow the same way as unsigned ones, with <code>INT_MAX + 1 == INT_MIN</code>, and yet, this is undefined behavior according to the C++ standard. This is very much intentional: if you disallow signed integer overflow, then <code>(x + 1) &gt; x</code> is guaranteed to be always true for <code>int</code>, but not for <code>unsigned int</code>, because <code>(x + 1)</code> may overflow. For signed types, this lets compilers optimize such checks away.</p><p>As a more naturally occurring example, consider the case of a loop with an integer control variable. Modern C++ and languages like Rust encourage programmers to use an unsigned integer (<code>size_t</code> / <code>usize</code>), while C programmers stubbornly keep using <code>int</code>. To understand why, consider the following <code>for</code> loop:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="c1">// ...
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"/><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How many times does this loop execute? There are technically two valid answers: $n$ and infinity, the second being the case if $n$ exceeds $2^{32}$ so that $i$ keeps resetting to zero every $2^{32}$ iterations. While the former is probably the one assumed by the programmer, to comply with the language spec, the compiler still has to insert additional runtime checks and consider the two cases, which should be optimized differently. Meanwhile, the <code>int</code> version would make exactly $n$ iterations because the very possibility of a signed overflow is defined out of existence.</p><span class="anchor" id="removing-corner-cases"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/contracts/#removing-corner-cases">#</a>Removing Corner Cases</h3><p>The “safe” programming style usually involves making a lot of runtime checks, but they do not have to come at the cost of performance.</p><p>For example, Rust famously uses bounds checking when indexing arrays and other random access structures. In C++ STL, <code>vector</code> and <code>array</code> have an “unsafe” <code>[]</code> operator and a “safe” <code>.at()</code> method that goes something like this:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">T</span> <span class="nf">at</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size_t</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">size</span><span class="p">())</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">out_of_range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Array index exceeds its size"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">_memory</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Interestingly, these checks are rarely actually executed during runtime because the compiler can often prove — during compile time — that each access will be within bounds. For example, when iterating in a <code>for</code> loop from 1 to the array size and indexing $i$-th element on each step, nothing illegal can possibly happen, so the bounds checks can be safely optimized away.</p><span class="anchor" id="assumptions"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/contracts/#assumptions">#</a>Assumptions</h3><p>When the compiler can’t prove the inexistence of corner cases, but <em>you</em> can, this additional information can be provided using the mechanism of undefined behavior.</p><p>Clang has a helpful <code>__builtin_assume</code> function where you can put a statement that is guaranteed to be true, and the compiler will use this assumption in optimization. In GCC, you can do the same with <code>__builtin_unreachable</code>:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">assume</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">pred</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For instance, you can put <code>assume(k &lt; vector.size())</code> before <code>at</code> in the example above, and then the bounds check will be optimized away.</p><p>It is also quite useful to combine <code>assume</code> with <code>assert</code> and <code>static_assert</code> to find bugs: you can use the same function to check preconditions in the debug build and then use them to improve performance in the production build.</p><span class="anchor" id="arithmetic"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/contracts/#arithmetic">#</a>Arithmetic</h3><p>Corner cases are something you should keep in mind, especially when optimizing arithmetic.</p><p>For <a href="/hpc/arithmetic/float">floating-point arithmetic</a>, this is less of a concern because you can just disable strict standard compliance with the <code>-ffast-math</code> flag (which is also included in <code>-Ofast</code>). You almost have to do it anyway because otherwise, the compiler can’t do anything but execute arithmetic operations in the same order as in the source code without any optimizations.</p><p>For integer arithmetic, this is different because the results always have to be exact. Consider the case of division by 2:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="nf">div_unsigned</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A widely known optimization is to replace it with a single right shift (<code>x &gt;&gt; 1</code>):</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">shr</span> <span class="nb">eax</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Although in this particular case, perhaps the best syntax to express that we only expect non-negative numbers is to use an unsigned integer type.</p><p>Because of nuances like this, it is often beneficial to expand the algebra in intermediate functions and manually simplify arithmetic yourself rather than relying on the compiler to do it.</p><span class="anchor" id="memory-aliasing"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/contracts/#memory-aliasing">#</a>Memory Aliasing</h3><p>Compilers are quite bad at optimizing operations that involve memory reads and writes.
