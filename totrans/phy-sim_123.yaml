- en: Collision detection in 3D can be significantly more computationally intensive
    than in 2D due to the larger number of surface primitives involved. Thankfully,
    spatial data structures like spatial hashing and bounding volume hierarchies (BVH)
    help efficiently reduce the number of candidate primitive pairs, making continuous
    collision detection (CCD) more manageable.

- en: The core idea of spatial hashing is to partition the space into a uniform grid
    and assign each grid cell an array to store the indices of primitives whose bounding
    boxes intersect with that cell. To find the nearby primitives of a given primitive
    A (e.g., a point), we identify the grid cells intersecting with A's bounding box
    and retrieve the primitive indices stored in these cells. This approach ensures
    that only nearby primitives are checked for collisions using CCD, eliminating
    the need for a nested loop to examine all primitive pairs.

- en: BVH is another effective method for broad-phase collision detection. It organizes
    primitives into a hierarchy of bounding volumes, allowing for efficient pruning
    of the search space when detecting potential collisions.

- en: The ACCD (Adaptive Continuous Collision Detection) method, as discussed in [Continuous
    Collision Detection](./lec21.4-ccd.html), is applicable in 3D. In this context,
    the distance calculations need to be adapted for point-triangle and edge-edge
    pairs.

- en: For computing the barrier potential energy, gradient, and Hessian, it is faster
    and essential to first gather a set of nearby candidate primitive pairs. Then,
    we compute their distances to determine if they are active (i.e., within a distance
    d^). This filtering process is part of the broad-phase collision detection and
    can be efficiently implemented using spatial hashing or BVH.

    load, focusing our detailed collision checks on a manageable subset of nearby
    primitives.
