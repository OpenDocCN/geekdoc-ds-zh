<p>Software is a kind of condensed collaboration. It’s a big help in
everyday life but it is also easy to take for granted. The research
and teaching I do depends on tools that other people freely write,
maintain, and distribute. My first debt is therefore to all of those
who produce and maintain R, the infrastructure that supports it, and
the packages built on its foundations. The particular libraries used
in the book are cited throughout the text and referenced in the
bibliography. I am also grateful to those in the R community who
helped me while I wrote this book, whether directly, though comments
and suggestions; indirectly, by independently solving problems I ran
into myself; or unwittingly, via the excellent example of their own
open and generous style of work. In particular I thank Jenny Bryan,
Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Thomas Lumley, John
MacFarlane, Bob Rudis, Hadley Wickham, Claus O. Wilke, and Yihui Xie.</p>
<p>A conversation with Chris Bail, a co-authored paper with Jim Moody <span class="citation">(Healy &amp; Moody, 2014)</span>, and a suggestion from Steve Vaisey got me started on this project. Duke University and the Kenan Institute for Ethics gave me time to see
it through. Martin Ruef and Suzanne Shanahan made the necessary room.
My students and seminar participants at Duke, Yale, McGill, the
University of Oslo, and Statistical Horizons were test-pilots for much
of the material and provided invaluable feedback. I thank Andy
Papachristos, Tom Lyttleton, Torkild Lyngstad, Amélie Quesnel-Vallée,
Shelley Clark, and Paul Allison for the external teaching
opportunities.</p>
<p>At Princeton University Press, Meagan Levinson has been an ideal
editor in every respect. Her expert guidance and enthusiasm throughout
the writing and production of the book made everything move a lot
quicker than expected. Four anonymous readers for the Press provided
detailed and helpful comments that improved the manuscript
substantially. I also received excellent feedback from Andrew Gelman,
Eszter Hargittai, Matissa Hollister, Eric Lawrence, and Matt Salganik.
Any remaining errors are of course my own.</p>
<p>For many years, Laurie Paul gave her encouragement and support to this
and other projects. I thank her for that. <em>Is cuma leis an mhaidin cad
air a ngealann sí.</em></p>
<p>For their professionalism as colleagues or their kindness
as friends I am grateful to Sam Anthony, Courtney Bender, Andrea Deeker, Mary Dixon-Woods, John Evans, Tina Fetner, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Erin Kelly, Liz Morgan, Brian Steensland, Craig Upright, Rebekah Estrada Vaisey, and Steve Vaisey. Marion Fourcade has both these qualities but also a third—patience as a co-author—that I fear I have tried beyond reason.</p>
<p>Much of this book was written on the Robertson Scholars Bus, which
goes back and forth between Duke and Chapel Hill on the half hour
during term. It’s a big help in everyday life but it is also easy to
take for granted. Its existence is worth any amount of handwaving
about connection and collaboration, however. The best seats are near
the front, facing sideways.</p>
