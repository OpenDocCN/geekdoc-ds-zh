    system of equations, as outlined in Equation [(1.5.2)](lec1.5-implicit_time_integration.html#eq:lec1:system_IE).
    Effectively, this equates to addressing an optimization problem stated as: xn+1where E(x)​=argxmin​E(x)=21​∥x−x~n∥M2​+Δt2P(x).​(2.1.1)
    Here, \(\tilde{x}^n = x^n + \Delta t v^n\), \(\frac{1}{2} \|x - \tilde{x}^n\|^2_M
    = \frac{1}{2} (x - \tilde{x}^n)^T M (x - \tilde{x}^n)\) represents the inertia
    term, \(P(x)\) stands for the potential energy for forces \(f(x)\) with \(\frac{\partial
    P}{\partial x}(x) = -f(x)\), and \(E(x)\) is known as the **Incremental Potential**.
    At the local minimum of \(E(x)\), \(\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}(x^{n+1}) = 0\),
    corresponding to Equation [(1.5.2)](lec1.5-implicit_time_integration.html#eq:lec1:system_IE).'

    optimization methods to robustly acquire the solutions. It also allows for a consistent
    framework for modeling more complex physical phenomena.

    potential energy \(P(x)\) exists such that \(\frac{\partial P(x)}{\partial x}
    = -f(x)\), are termed **conservative forces**. Both common elasticity forces and
    body forces such as gravity are examples of conservative forces. They can be easily
    integrated into the optimization framework by adding the potential energy term
    into the Incremental Potential.'

    on an object of mass \(m\) (represented by the force \(F = -mg\mathbf{z}\)) at
    a height \(h\) above the Earth''s surface, where \(g\) is the acceleration due
    to gravity and \(\mathbf{z}\) is the upward-pointing unit vector, corresponds
    to the gravitational potential energy \(U = mgh\). Here, \(U\) is the work done
    against gravity to move the object from a reference point (at \(h = 0\)) to height
    \(h\). The force is the negative gradient of the energy with respect to the position
    (written mathematically as \(F = -\nabla U\)), which confirms the principle of
    conservation of energy. Taking the derivative of \(U\) with respect to \(h\),
    we obtain \(\nabla U = mg\mathbf{z}\), and thus \(F = -\nabla U = -mg\mathbf{z}\),
    which matches our starting expression for the force.'

- en: '***Remark 2.1.2 (Elasticity).*** Elasticity is the capacity of a solid object
    to maintain its resting shape in response to external forces. Under the influence
    of elasticity, the sample points on the same solid will be *bound* together during
    the simulation. A more rigid solid will have a stiffer elasticity energy, providing
    a larger elasticity force for the same degree of deformation, thereby aiding in
    the restoration of the resting shape. The Armadillo slingshot example ([Figure
    1.3.1](lec1.3-time_integration.html#fig:lec1:slingshot)) demonstrates typical
    elasticity effects. Elasticity is a common property across all solids, regardless
    of their geometric form, and whether they are intuitively rigid or non-rigid,
    e.g., metal, wood, soft tissue, rubber, cloth, hair, sand, etc.'
