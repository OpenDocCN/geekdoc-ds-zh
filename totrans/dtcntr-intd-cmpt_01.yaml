    and do so in ways that are of practical value and importance. However, it will
    also go beyond programming to computer science, a rich, deep, fascinating, and
    beautiful intellectual discipline. You will learn many useful things that you
    can apply right away, but we will also show you some of what lies beneath and
    beyond.

    computation. Some of these ways are technical methods, such as working from data
    and examples to construct solutions to problems. Others are scientific methods,
    such as ways of making sure that programs are reliable and do what they claim.
    Finally, some are social, thinking about the impacts that programs have on people.

    consequence does that have?
  prefs: []

- en: 'At a computational level, data have had a profound effect. Traditionally, the
    only way to make a program better was to improve the program directly, which often
    meant making it more complicated and impacting the values we discuss above. But
    there are classes of programs for which there is another method: simply give the
    same program more or better data, and the program can improve. These data-driven
    programs lie at the heart of many innovations we see around us.'

    too. Most introductory programming is plagued by artificial data that have no
    real meaning, interest, or consequence (and often, artificial problems to accompany
    them). With real data, learners can personalize their education, focusing on problems
    they find meaningful, enriching, or just plain fun—<wbr>asking and answering questions
    they find worthwhile. Indeed, from this perspective, programs interrogate data:
    that is, programs are tools for answering questions. In turn, the emphasis on
    real data and real questions enables us to discuss the social impacts of computing.'

    data science. However, typical data science curricula also have many limitations.
    They pay little attention to what we know about the difficulties of learning to
    program. They have little emphasis on software reliability. And they fail to recognize
    that their data are often quite limited in their structure. These limitations,
    where data science typically ends, are where computer science begins. In particular,
    the structure of data serve as a point of departure for thinking about and achieving
    some of the values above—<wbr>performance, reliability, and predictability—<wbr>using

    of program behavior meant to help students understand how programs work—<wbr>but
    few curricula actually use one. We take notional machines seriously, developing
    a sequence of them and weaving them through the curriculum. This ties to our belief
    that programs are not only objects that run, but also objects that we reason about.
  prefs: []

    other efforts that focus on exposing students to ethics or the pitfalls of technology
    in general, we aim to show students how the constructs and concepts that they
    are turning into code right now can lead to adverse impacts unless used with care.
    In keeping with our focus on testing and concrete examples, we introduce several
    topics by getting students to think about assumptions at the level of concrete
    data. This material is called out explicitly throughout the book.

    Our choices of material, order of presentation, programming methods, and more

    relationship. You can find our papers (some with each other, others not) [on](https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/Pubs/index.html)

    explanations of and metaphors for state (e.g., “a variable is a box”). Thus, they
    have a poor understanding of it beyond the absolute basics, especially when they
    get to important topics like aliasing. As a result, many of these students have

    they find worthwhile. Indeed, from this perspective, programs interrogate data:

    computation. Some of these ways are technical methods, such as working from data
    and examples to construct solutions to problems. Others are scientific methods,
    such as ways of making sure that programs are reliable and do what they claim.
    Finally, some are social, thinking about the impacts that programs have on people.

    they find meaningful, enriching, or just plain fun—<wbr>asking and answering questions
    they find worthwhile. Indeed, from this perspective, programs interrogate data:
