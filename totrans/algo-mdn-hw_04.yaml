    was to rely primarily on the empirical approach. Not understanding how computers
    really worked, I would semi-randomly swap nested loops, rearrange arithmetic,
    combine branch conditions, inline functions by hand, and follow all sorts of other
    performance tips I’ve heard from other people, blindly hoping for improvement.

    about performance do not teach you to reason about software performance qualitatively.
    Instead they give you general advice about certain implementation approaches —
    and general performance intuition is clearly not enough.

    computer architecture *before* doing algorithmic programming. So, even if most
    people aren’t *excited* about it, we are going to spend the first few chapters
    studying how CPUs work and start with learning assembly.
