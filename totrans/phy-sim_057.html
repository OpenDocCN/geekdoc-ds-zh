<p>Kinematic Collision Objects (CO) and Moving Dirichlet Boundary Conditions (BC) are crucial in many simulation scenarios. A CO can be considered as a collection of BC nodes.</p>
<p>At the start of a time step, it is ideal if the BC nodes can be moved directly to their prescribed locations without causing any interpenetrations. This allows the simulation to proceed smoothly using the <a href="lec5.2-DOF_elimin.html">Degree of Freedom (DOF) elimination method</a>, which ensures the constraints remain feasible.</p>
<p>However, with large time steps, high velocities, or significant deformations, directly prescribing BC nodes often leads to interpenetration or "tunneling" artifacts, where objects pass through each other unrealistically.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, the penalty method is applied. This method progressively adjusts the simulation towards a feasible set where both CO and BC constraints are satisfied, and interpenetrations are avoided.</p>
<p>A case study demonstrating these principles will be shown through the simulation of a compressed square.</p>
