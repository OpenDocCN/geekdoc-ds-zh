<h1>Preface<a href="index.html#preface" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h1>
<p>This book is intended to be a relatively gentle introduction to carrying out Bayesian data analysis and cognitive modeling using the probabilistic programming language Stan <span class="citation">(Carpenter et al. <a href="#ref-carpenter2017stan" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, and the front-end to Stan called <code>brms</code> <span class="citation">(Bürkner <a href="#ref-R-brms" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>. Our target audience is cognitive scientists (e.g., linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists) who carry out planned behavioral experiments, and who are interested in learning the Bayesian data analysis methodology from the ground up and in a principled manner. Our aim is to make Bayesian statistics a standard part of the data analysis toolkit for experimental linguistics, psycholinguistics, psychology, and related disciplines.</p>
<p>Many excellent introductory textbooks already exist for Bayesian data analysis. Why write yet another book? Our text is different from other attempts in two respects. First, our main focus is on showing how to analyze data from planned experiments involving repeated measures; this type of experimental data involves unique complexities. We provide many examples of data sets involving time measurements (e.g., self-paced reading, eye-tracking-while-reading, voice onset time), event-related potentials, pupil sizes, accuracies (e.g., recall tasks, yes-no questions), categorical answers (e.g., picture naming), choice-reaction time (e.g, the Stroop task, the motion detection task), etc. Second, from the very outset, we emphasize a particular workflow that has as its centerpiece simulating data; we aim to teach a philosophy that involves thinking hard about the assumed underlying generative process, <strong>even before the data are collected</strong>. The data analysis approach that we hope to teach through this book involves a cycle of prior predictive and posterior predictive checks, sensitivity analyses, and model validation using simulated data. We try to inculcate a sense of how inferences can be drawn from the posterior distribution of theoretically interesting parameters without resorting to binary decisions like “significant” or “not-significant.” We are hopeful that this will set a new standard for reporting and interpreting results of data analyses in a more nuanced manner, and lead to more measured claims in the published literature.</p>

<h2>Why read this book, and what is its target audience?<a href="index.html#why-read-this-book-and-what-is-its-target-audience" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>A commonly-held belief in psychology, psycholinguistics, and other areas is that statistical data analysis is secondary to the science, and should be quick and easy. For example, a senior mathematical psychologist once told the last author of this book: “if you need to run anything more complicated than a paired t-test, you are asking the wrong question.” We take a different perspective here: the science and the statistical modeling are one unitary thing. The statistical model should represent some reasonable approximation of the latent cognitive processes that are assumed to be in play.</p>
<p>The target audience for this book is students and researchers who want to treat statistics as an equal partner in their scientific work. We expect that the reader is willing to take the time to both understand and to run the computational analyses.</p>
<p>Any rigorous introduction to Bayesian data analysis requires at least a passive knowledge of probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra. However, we do not require that the reader has this background when they start the book. Instead, the relevant ideas are introduced informally and just in time, as soon as they are needed. The reader is never required to have an active ability to solve probability problems, to solve integrals or compute derivatives, or to carry out matrix computations (such as inverting matrices) by hand. There are a few places where the discussion becomes technical and requires some knowledge of calculus or related topics. However, the reader unfamiliar with the required mathematics can simply skip those sections, as these are not really necessary to follow the main thread of the book.</p>
<p>What we do expect is familiarity with arithmetic, basic set theory and elementary probability theory (e.g., sum and product rules, conditional probability), simple matrix operations like addition and multiplication, and simple algebraic operations. A quick look through chapter 1 of <span class="citation">Gill (<a href="#ref-gill2006essential" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> before starting this book is highly recommended. We also presuppose that, when the need arises, the reader is willing to look up concepts that that they might have forgotten (e.g., logarithms). We also provide a self-paced course on some basic concepts in mathematics (aimed at non-mathematicians) which the reader can work through: see <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/FoM/" class="uri">https://vasishth.github.io/FoM/</a>.</p>
<p>We also expect that the reader already knows and/or is willing to learn enough of the programming language R <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-base" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> to reproduce the examples presented and to carry out the exercises. If the reader is completely unfamiliar with R, before starting this book they should first consult books like <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for data science</a>, and <a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/">Efficient R programming</a>. Readers familiar with python may find the python port of the first five chapters by Jozsef Arato useful (<a href="https://github.com/jozsarato/bayescogdat" class="uri">https://github.com/jozsarato/bayescogdat</a>).</p>
<p>We also assume that the reader has encountered simple linear modeling, and linear mixed models <span class="citation">(Bates, Mächler, et al. <a href="#ref-R-lme4" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Baayen, Davidson, and Bates <a href="#ref-baayen2008mixed" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. What this means in practice is that the reader should have used the <code>lm()</code> and <code>lmer()</code> functions in R. A passing acquaintance with basic statistical concepts, like the correlation between two variables, is also taken for granted.</p>
<p>This book is not appropriate for complete beginners to data analysis. Newcomers to data analysis should start with a freely available textbook like <span class="citation">Kerns (<a href="#ref-kerns2014introduction" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, and then read our introduction to frequentist data analysis, which is also available freely online <span class="citation">(Vasishth, Schad, et al. <a href="#ref-VasishthEtAlFreq2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. This latter book will prepare the reader well for the material presented here.</p>

<h2>Developing the right mindset for this book<a href="index.html#developing-the-right-mindset-for-this-book" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>One very important characteristic that the reader should bring to this book is a can-do spirit. There will be many places where the going will get tough, and the reader will have to slow down and play around with the material, or refresh their understanding of arithmetic or middle-school algebra.
The basic principles of such a can-do spirit are nicely summarized in the book by <span class="citation">Burger and Starbird (<a href="#ref-burger" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>; also see <span class="citation">Levy (<a href="#ref-danlevy" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. Although we cannot summarize all the insights from these books in a few words, inspired by the <span class="citation">Burger and Starbird (<a href="#ref-burger" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> book, here is a short enumeration of the kind of mindset the reader will need to cultivate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend time on the basic, apparently easy material; make sure you understand it deeply. Look for gaps in your understanding. Reading different presentations of the same material (in different books or articles) can yield new insights.</li>
<li>Let mistakes and errors be your teacher. We instinctively recoil from our mistakes, but errors are ultimately our friends; they have the potential to teach us more than our correct answers can. In this sense, a correct solution can be less interesting than an incorrect one.</li>
<li>When you are intimidated by some exercise or problem, give up and admit defeat immediately. This relaxes the mind; you’ve already given up, there’s nothing more to do. Then, after a while, try to solve a simpler version of the problem. Sometimes, it is useful to break the problem down to smaller parts, each of which may be easier to solve.</li>
<li>Create your own questions. Don’t wait to be asked questions; develop your own problems and then try to solve them.</li>
<li>Don’t expect to understand everything in the first pass. Just mentally note the gaps in your understanding, and return to them later and work on these gaps.</li>
<li>Step back periodically to try to sketch out a broader picture of what you are learning. Writing down what you know, without looking up anything, is one helpful way to achieve this. Don’t wait for the teacher to give you bullet-point summaries of what you should have learned; develop such summaries yourself.</li>
<li>Develop the art of finding information. When confronted with something you don’t know, or with some obscure error message, use google to find some answers.</li>
<li>Do not hesitate to re-read a chapter; often, one only understands a topic after one revisits the material.</li>
</ul>
<p>As instructors, we have noticed over the years that students with such a mindset generally do very well. Some students already have that spirit, but others need to explicitly develop it. We firmly believe that everyone can develop such a mindset, but one may have to work on acquiring it. In any case, such an attitude is necessary for a book of this sort.</p>

<h2>How to read this book<a href="index.html#how-to-read-this-book" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>The chapters in this book are intended to be read in sequence, but during the first pass through the book, readers should feel free to skip the optional, in-depth materials available online. These resources provide a more formal development <span class="citation">(useful to transition to more advanced textbooks like Gelman et al. <a href="#ref-Gelman14" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, or deal with tangential aspects of the topics presented in the chapter.</p>
<p>Here are some suggested paths through this book, depending on the reader’s goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a short course for complete beginners, read chapters <a href="ch-intro.html#ch-intro">1</a> to <a href="ch-hierarchical.html#ch-hierarchical">5</a>. We usually cover these five chapters in a five-day summer school course that we teach annually. Most of the material in these chapters are also covered in a free four-week course available online: <a href="https://open.hpi.de/courses/bayesian-statistics2023" class="uri">https://open.hpi.de/courses/bayesian-statistics2023</a>.</li>
<li>For a course that focuses on regression models with the R package <code>brms</code>, read chapters <a href="ch-intro.html#ch-intro">1</a> to <a href="ch-coding2x2.html#ch-coding2x2">7</a> and, optionally, <a href="ch-bf.html#ch-bf">13</a>.</li>
<li>For an advanced course that focuses on complex models involving Stan, read chapters <a href="ch-introstan.html#ch-introstan">8</a> to <a href="ch-lognormalrace.html#ch-lognormalrace">18</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some conventions used in this book<a href="index.html#some-conventions-used-in-this-book" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>We adopt the following conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All distribution names are lower-case unless they are also a proper name (e.g., Poisson, Bernoulli).</li>
<li>The univariate normal distribution is parameterized by the mean and standard deviation (not variance).</li>
<li>The code for figures is provided only in some cases, where we consider it to be pedagogically useful. In other cases, the code remains hidden, but it can be found in the web version of the book (<a href="https://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci/">https://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci/</a>). Notice that all the R code from the book can be extracted from the Rmd source files for each chapter, which are released with the book (<a href="https://github.com/bnicenboim/bayescogsci">https://github.com/bnicenboim/bayescogsci</a>).</li>

<h2>Software needed<a href="index.html#software-needed" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>Before you start, please install</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, or any other Integrated Development Environment that you prefer, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://ess.r-project.org/">Emacs Speaks Statistics</a>.</li>
<li>The R package <code>rstan</code>. At the time of writing this book, the CRAN version of <code>rstan</code> lags behind the latest developments in Stan so it is recommended to install <code>rstan</code> from <code>https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/</code> as indicated in <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started" class="uri">https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started</a></li>
<li>The R packages <code>dplyr</code>, <code>purrr</code>, <code>tidyr</code>, <code>extraDistr</code>, <code>brms</code>, <code>hypr</code> and <code>lme4</code> are used in many chapters of the book and can be installed the usual way: <code>install.packages(c("dplyr","purrr","tidyr", "extraDistr", "brms","hypr","lme4"))</code>. We use <code>ggplot2</code> for figures; please consult the relevant documentation if you are unfamiliar with <code>ggplot2</code> <span class="citation">(e.g., Wickham, Chang, et al. <a href="#ref-R-ggplot2" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>The following R packages are optional: <code>tictoc</code>, <code>rootSolve</code>, <code>SHELF</code>, <code>cmdstanr</code>, and <code>SBC</code>.</li>
<li>Some packages and their dependencies, such as <code>intoo</code>, <code>barsurf</code>, <code>bivariate</code>, and <code>SIN</code> could require manual installation from archived or github versions. For such packages, go to the CRAN archive: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/">https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/</a>; download the tar.gz of the relevant package; and then install it from the command line using the command <code>R CMD INSTALL package.tar.gz</code>.</li>
<li>The data and Stan models used in this book can be installed using <code>remotes::install_github("bnicenboim/bcogsci")</code>. This command uses the function <code>install_github()</code> from the package <code>remotes</code>. (Thus this package should be in the system as well.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In every R session, load these packages, and set the options shown below for Stan.</p>
