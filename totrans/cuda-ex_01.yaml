- en: This book shows how, by harnessing the power of your computer’s graphics process
    unit (GPU), you can write high-performance software for a wide range of applications.
    Although originally designed to render computer graphics on a monitor (and still
    used for this purpose), GPUs are increasingly being called upon for equally demanding
    programs in science, engineering, and finance, among other domains. We refer collectively
    to GPU programs that address problems in nongraphics domains as *general-purpose*.
    Happily, although you need to have some experience working in C or C++ to benefit
    from this book, you need not have any knowledge of computer graphics. None whatsoever!
    GPU programming simply offers you an opportunity to build—and to build mightily—on
    your existing programming skills.

- en: To program NVIDIA GPUs to perform general-purpose computing tasks, you will
    want to know what CUDA is. NVIDIA GPUs are built on what’s known as the *CUDA
    Architecture*. You can think of the CUDA Architecture as the scheme by which NVIDIA
    has built GPUs that can perform *both* traditional graphics-rendering tasks *and*
    general-purpose tasks. To program CUDA GPUs, we will be using a language known
    as *CUDA C*. As you will see very early in this book, CUDA C is essentially C
    with a handful of extensions to allow programming of massively parallel machines
    like NVIDIA GPUs.

- en: We’ve geared *CUDA by Example* toward experienced C or C++ programmers who have
    enough familiarity with C such that they are comfortable reading and writing code
    in C. This book builds on your experience with C and intends to serve as an example-driven,
    “quick-start” guide to using NVIDIA’s CUDA C programming language. By no means
    do you need to have done large-scale software architecture, to have written a
    C compiler or an operating system kernel, or to know all the ins and outs of the
    ANSI C standards. However, we do not spend time reviewing C syntax or common C
    library routines such as `malloc()` or `memcpy()`, so we will assume that you
    are already reasonably familiar with these topics.

- en: You will encounter some techniques that can be considered general parallel programming
    paradigms, although this book does not aim to teach general parallel programming
    techniques. Also, while we will look at nearly every part of the CUDA API, this
    book does not serve as an extensive API reference nor will it go into gory detail
    about every tool that you can use to help develop your CUDA C software. Consequently,
    we highly recommend that this book be used in conjunction with NVIDIA’s freely
    available documentation, in particular the *NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide* and
    the *NVIDIA CUDA Best Practices Guide*. But don’t stress out about collecting
    all these documents because we’ll walk you through everything you need to do.

    [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02) of this book discusses which components are absolutely
    necessary in order to get started writing CUDA C programs. Because this book aims
    to teach by example, it contains a great deal of code samples. This code can be
    downloaded from [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda-by-example.html](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda-by-example.html).
