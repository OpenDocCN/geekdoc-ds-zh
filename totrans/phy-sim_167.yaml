- en: The Position Based Dynamics framework provides a robust and efficient method
    for physics-based simulation. Its core is a simple time-stepping loop that predicts
    new particle positions and then iteratively corrects them using a Gauss-Seidel
    solver. The mathematical basis for this correction is a projection derived from
    a linearized constraint function, weighted by inverse particle masses to produce
    physically plausible motion. This approach neatly sidesteps the stability problems
    of traditional explicit integrators. By defining different constraint functions,
    the same general solver can be used to simulate a wide variety of physical phenomena,
    from deformable solids to cloth and fluids. The framework is further enhanced
    by practical features like tunable stiffness and momentum-conserving damping,
    making it exceptionally well-suited for real-time applications.
