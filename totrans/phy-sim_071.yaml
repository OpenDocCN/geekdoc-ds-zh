- en: Stress is a tensor field, akin to the deformation gradient F, and is defined
    over the entire domain of solid materials. It quantifies the internal pressures
    and tensions experienced by a material object. The link between stress and strain
    (or F) is established through what is known as a **constitutive relationship**.
    This relationship outlines how materials respond to various deformations.

- en: A common example of a constitutive relationship is Hooke's law in one dimension,
    which applies to many conventional materials under elastic conditions. In the
    context of **hyperelastic materials**, the relationship is specifically defined
    by the strain energy function, Ψ(F).

    are those elastic solids whose **first Piola-Kirchhoff stress** P can be derived
    from a strain energy density function Ψ(F) via P=∂F∂Ψ​.(14.1.1) With index notation,
    this means Pij​=∂Fij​∂Ψ​. P is discretely a small matrix with the same dimensions
    as F.'

    with **Cauchy stress** being particularly prevalent in engineering contexts. Cauchy
    stress, denoted as σ(⋅,t):Ωt→Rd×d, can be mathematically linked to the first Piola-Kirchhoff
    stress tensor P through the relationship: σ=J1​PFT=det(F)1​∂F∂Ψ​FT.'

- en: Calculating P from the strain energy function Ψ(F) is relatively straightforward
    for energy models that do not require singular value decomposition (SVD), such
    as the Neo-Hookean model. However, general isotropic elasticity models, like ARAP
    (As-Rigid-As-Possible), often rely on the computation of principal stretches or
    the closest rotation matrix, necessitating SVD. This computation becomes particularly
    complex and resource-intensive when determining ∂F∂P​, which is crucial for implicit
    time integrations.

- en: We present an efficient method that leverages the sparsity structure, as introduced
    by [[Stomakhin et al. 2012]](bibliography.html#stomakhin2012energetically), to
    compute the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor P and its derivative ∂F∂P​ (whether
    as a tensor or the differential δP) for general isotropic elastic materials. This
    approach utilizes symbolic software packages, and we will specifically discuss
    the implementation in *Mathematica*. Implementations in *Maple* or other software
    are similarly straightforward, following the same conceptual framework. For a
    deeper exploration of derivative computations commonly employed in computer graphics,
    refer to the work of [[Schroeder 2022]](bibliography.html#schroeder2022practical).

- en: 'It is important to note that the computational strategy discussed can also
    be applied to other derivatives in diagonal space, similar to ∂F∂P​. For instance,
    in certain models, the **Kirchhoff stress** τ is preferred over the first Piola-Kirchhoff
    stress P. The Kirchhoff stress is expressed as: τ=Uτ^UT, where τ^ is a diagonal
    stress measure, with each entry being a function of the singular values Σ. The
    methodology for computing ∂F∂τ​ mirrors that of P.'
