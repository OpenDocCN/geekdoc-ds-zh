    aren''t axis-aligned, the direct Degree of Freedom (DOF) elimination method faces
    certain limitations. This becomes evident particularly when \( AA^T \) is not
    an \( m \times m \) identity matrix. According to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
    system (Equation [(5.1.3)](lec5.1-equality_constraints.html#eq:lec5:BC_KKT)),
    the Lagrange multiplier vector \( \lambda \) can be solved as follows:'

    I - A^T (AA^T)^{-1} A \) does not possess a special structure that can be conveniently
    exploited to derive an equivalent, non-singular system while still satisfying
    the constraints. This makes the direct application of the DOF elimination method
    impractical for general slip DBCs.

    set of variables, making the constraints as straightforward as those in sticky
    DBC. To achieve this, we employ singular value decomposition (SVD) on the constraint
    Jacobian matrix \( A \). The SVD of \( A \) is expressed as: A=USVT. Here, \(
    U \) is a \( m \times m \) orthogonal matrix, \( V \) is a \( dn \times dn \)
    orthogonal matrix, and \( S \) is a \( m \times dn \) diagonal matrix.'

    of the diagonal matrix \( S \) in the off-diagonal blocks allows the direct application

    needs to be linearly independent but does not necessarily have to be orthonormal.
    This insight opens up the possibility of identifying a sparse basis set. Such
    a set can maintain computational efficiency when dealing with general linear equality
    constraints. For a practical example of this approach, see [[Chen et al. 2022]](bibliography.html#chen2022unified).
