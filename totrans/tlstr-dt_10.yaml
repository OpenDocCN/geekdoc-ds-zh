    us to communicate efficiently. It is also a way to work out what we believe and
    allows us to get feedback on our ideas. Effective papers are tightly written and

    for ourselves. Specifically, we write to be useful to the reader. This means clearly
    communicating something new, true, and important ([Graham 2020](99-references.html#ref-grahamhowtowriteusefully)).
    That said, the greatest benefit of writing nonetheless often accrues to the writer,

    by immediately adding headings such as: “Introduction”, “Data”, “Model”, “Results”,
    and “Discussion”. And then adding fields in the top matter for the various bits
    and pieces that are needed, such as “title”, “date”, “author”, and “abstract”.
    This creates a generic outline, which will play the role of *mise en place* for
    the paper. By way of background, *mise en place* is a preparatory phase in a professional
    kitchen when ingredients are sorted, prepared, and arranged for easy access. This
    ensures that everything that is needed is available without unnecessary delay.
    Putting together an outline plays the same role when writing quantitative papers,
    and is akin to placing on the counter, the ingredients that we will use to prepare
    dinner ([McPhee 2017](99-references.html#ref-draftnumberfour)).'

- en: Having established this generic outline, we need to develop an understanding
    of what we are exploring through thinking deeply about our research question.
    In theory, we develop a research question, answer it, and then do all the writing;
    but that rarely actually happens ([Franklin 2005](99-references.html#ref-franklin2005exploratory)).
    Instead, we typically have some idea of the question and the shape of an answer,
    and these become less vague as we write. This is because it is through the process
    of writing that we refine our thinking ([S. King 2000, 131](99-references.html#ref-stephenking)).
    Having put down some thoughts about the research question, we can start to add
    dot points in each of the sections, adding sub-sections with informative sub-headings
    as needed. We then go back and expand those dot points into paragraphs. While
    we do this our thinking is influenced by a web of other researchers, but also
    other aspects such as our circumstances and environment ([Latour 1996](99-references.html#ref-latour)).

    if they are bad, and the first draft is when you accomplish this. Remove distractions
    and focus on writing. Perfectionism is the enemy, and should be set aside. Sometimes
    this can be accomplished by getting up very early to write, by creating a deadline,
    or forming a writing group. Creating a sense of urgency can be useful and one
    option is to not bother with adding proper citations as you go, which could slow
    you down, and instead just add something like “[TODO: CITE R HERE]”. Do similar
    with graphs and tables. That is, include textual descriptions such as “[TODO:
    ADD GRAPH THAT SHOWS EACH COUNTRY OVER TIME HERE]” instead of actual graphs and
    tables. Focus on adding content, even if it is bad. When this is all done, a first

    a bad first draft that you can get to a good second draft, a great third draft,
    and eventually excellence ([Lamott 1994, 20](99-references.html#ref-birdbybird)).
    That first draft will be too long, it will not make sense, it will contain claims
    that cannot be supported, and some claims that should not be. If you are not embarrassed
    by your first draft, then you have not written it quickly enough.

    first draft into a second. Print the draft and using a red pen to move or remove
    words, sentences, and entire paragraphs, is especially helpful. The process of
    going from a first draft to a second draft is best done in one sitting, to help
    with the flow and consistency of the story. One aspect of this first rewrite is
    enhancing the story that we want to tell. Another aspect is taking out everything
    that is not the story ([S. King 2000, 57](99-references.html#ref-stephenking)).

    a temporary document, perhaps named “debris.qmd”, to save these unwanted paragraphs
    instead of immediately deleting them. Another strategy is to comment out the paragraphs.
    That way you can still look at the raw file and notice aspects that could be useful.

    sense to it with special consideration to how it supports the story that is developing.
    This revision process is the essence of writing ([McPhee 2017, 160](99-references.html#ref-draftnumberfour)).
    You should also fix the references, and add the real graphs and tables. As part
    of this rewriting process, the paper’s central message tends to develop, and the
    answers to the research questions tend to become clearer. At this point, aspects
    such as the introduction can be returned to and, finally, the abstract. Typos
    and other issues affect the credibility of the work. So these should be fixed
    as part of the second draft.

    it brilliant. Print it and again go through it on paper. Try to remove everything
    that does not contribute to the story. At about this stage, you may start to get
    too close to the paper. This is a great opportunity to give it to someone else
    for their comments. Ask for feedback about what is weak about the story. After
    addressing these, it can be helpful to go through the paper once more, this time
    reading it aloud. A paper is never “done” and it is more that at a certain point
    you either run out of time or become sick of the sight of it.

    that we do not have complete cause of death data. If we did, then we could count

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Selection bias occurs when the results depend on who is in the sample. One of
    the pernicious aspects of selection bias is that we need to know about its existence
    in order to do anything about it. But many default diagnostics will not identify
    selection bias. In A/B testing, which we discuss in [Chapter 8](08-hunt.html),
    A/A testing is a slight variant where we create groups and compare them before
    imposing a treatment (hence the A/A nomenclature). This effort to check whether
    the groups are initially the same, can help to identify selection bias. More generally,
    comparing the properties of the sample, such as age-group, gender, and education,
    with characteristics of the population can assist as well. But the fundamental
    problem with selection bias and observational data is that we know people about
    whom we have data are different in at least one way to those about whom we do
    not! But we do not know in what other ways they may be different.
  prefs: []

- en: Selection bias can pervade many aspects of our analysis. Even a sample that
    is initially representative may become biased over time. For instance, survey
    panels, that we discuss in [Chapter 6](06-farm.html), need to be updated from
    time to time because the people who do not get anything out of it stop responding.

    is important that we are clear about specifics. For instance, we might be interested
    in the effect of smoking on life expectancy. In that case, there is some true
    effect, which we can never know, and that true effect is called the “estimand”
    ([Little and Lewis 2021](99-references.html#ref-Little2021)). Defining the estimand
    at some point in the paper, ideally in the introduction, is critical ([Lundberg,
    Johnson, and Stewart 2021](99-references.html#ref-Lundberg2021)). This is because
    it is easy to slightly change some specific aspect of the analysis plan and end
    up accidentally estimating something different ([Kahan et al. 2022](99-references.html#ref-becarefulaboutyourestimand)).
    They are beginning to be required by some medicine regulators ([Kahan et al. 2024](99-references.html#ref-kahan2024)).
    For an estimand we are looking for a clear description of what the effect represents
    ([Kahan et al. 2023](99-references.html#ref-Kahan2023)). An “estimator” is a process
    by which we use the data that we have available to generate an “estimate” of the
    “estimand”. Efron and Morris ([1977](99-references.html#ref-steinsparadox)) provide

    sum the draws and divide by the number of draws. Another is to order the draws

    This title is useful because the reader knows what the paper is about. But it
    is not particularly informative or enticing. A slightly better title could be
    “On the Vote Leave outcome in the 2016 Brexit referendum”. This variant adds informative
    specificity. We argue the best title would be something like “Vote Leave outperforms

    We then refine it over the course of redrafting. The title needs to reflect the
    final story of the paper, and this is not usually something that we know at the
    start. We must strike a balance between getting our reader interested enough to
    read the paper, and conveying enough of the content so as to be useful ([Hayot

    *The History of England from the Accession of James the Second* by Thomas Babington

    400-year history. Using this election as a case study, we show how gender did
    and did not influence the outcome. A survey of Montreal electors suggests that
    gender was not a salient factor in vote choice. Although gender did not matter
    much for voters, it did shape the organization of the campaign and party. We argue
    that Plante’s victory can be explained in part by a strategy that showcased a

    equality and government intervention as explanations. We argue the role of attitudes
    toward women in understanding support for policies aiming to increase the presence
    of women in politics is ambivalent—both hostile and benevolent forms of sexism
    contribute in understanding support, albeit in different ways. Using original
    data from a survey conducted on a probability-based sample of Australian respondents,
    our findings demonstrate that hostile sexists are more likely to oppose increasing
    of women’s presence in politics through the adoption of gender quotas. Benevolent
    sexists, on the other hand, are more likely to support these policies than respondents
    exhibiting low levels of benevolent sexism. We argue this is because benevolent
    sexism holds that women are pure and need protection; they do not have what it
    takes to succeed in politics without the assistance of quotas. Finally, we show
    that while women are more likely to support quotas, ambivalent sexism has the
    same relationship with support among both women and men. These findings suggest
    that aggregate levels of public support for gender quotas do not necessarily represent
    greater acceptance of gender equality generally.

    this algorithm. Although the number of allocations grows exponentially in the
    number of matches, our bound does not. In simulations based on refugee resettlement

    This relationship holds over time and across world regions. I test five donor-side
    explanations for pro-rich targeting using a pre-registered conjoint experiment
    on WB Task Team Leaders (TTLs). TTLs perceive aid-receiving governments as most
    interested in targeting aid politically and controlling implementation. They also
    believe that aid works better in poorer or more remote areas, but that implementation
    in these areas is uniquely difficult. These results speak to debates in distributive
    politics, international bargaining over aid, and principal-agent issues in international

    for each country, sex and year. The Gini coefficient measures dispersion or inequality
    among values of a frequency distribution. It can take any value between 0 and
    1\. In the case of income distributions, a Gini coefficient of 1 would mean one
    person has all the income. In this case, a Gini coefficient of 1 would mean that
    all babies have the same name. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 0 would mean
    names are evenly distributed across all babies.

    ([2013](99-references.html#ref-kharecha2013prevented)) and Kiang et al. ([2021](99-references.html#ref-kiang2021racial)).
    In the results section, we want to communicate the outcomes of the analysis in
    a clear way and without too much focus on the discussion of implications. The
    results section likely requires summary statistics, tables, and graphs. Each of
    those aspects should be cross-referenced and have text associated with them that
    details what is seen in each figure. This section should relay results; that is,
    we are interested in what the results are, rather than what they mean.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This section would also typically include tables of graphs of coefficient estimates
    based on the modeling. Various features of the estimates should be discussed,
    and differences between the models explained. It may be that different subsets
    of the data are considered separately. Again, all graphs and tables need to have
    text in plain language accompany them. A rough guide is that the amount of text
    should be at least equal to the amount of space taken up by the tables and graphs.
    For instance, if a full page is used to display a table of coefficient estimates,
    then that should be cross-referenced and accompanied by about a full page of text
    about that table.

    a brief summary of what was done in the paper. This would be followed by two or
    three sub-sections that are devoted to the key things that we learn about the
    world from this paper. These sub-sections are the main opportunity to justify
    or detail the implications of the story being told in the paper. Typically, these
    sub-sections do not see newly introduced graphs or tables, but are instead focused
    on what we learn from those that were introduced in earlier sections. It may be
    that some of the results are discussed in relation to what others have found,
    and differences could be attempted to be reconciled here.

    have a sub-section focused on some of the weaknesses of what was done. This could
    concern aspects such as the data that were used, the approach, and the model.
    In the case of the model we are especially concerned with those aspects that might
    affect the findings. This can be especially difficult in the case of machine learning
    models and Smith et al. ([2022](99-references.html#ref-realml)) provide guidance
    for aspects to consider. And the final sub-section is typically a few paragraphs
    that specify what is left to learn, and how future work could proceed.

    reader has other priorities. But it is also because as the writer it forces us
    to consider what our most important points are, how we can best support them,
    and where our arguments are weakest. Jean Chrétien, is a former Canadian prime
    minister. In Chrétien ([2007, 105](99-references.html#ref-jeanchretien)) he wrote
    that he used to ask “\(\dots\)the officials to summarize their documents in two
    or three pages and attach the rest of the materials as background information.
    I soon discovered that this was a problem only for those who didn’t really know
    what they were talking about” .

    British cabinet member, describes there being “a huge amount of terrible guff,
    at huge, colossal, humongous length coming from some departments” and how he asked
    “for them to be one quarter of the length”. He found that the departments were
    able to accommodate this request without losing anything important. Winston Churchill
    asked for brevity during the Second World War, saying “the discipline of setting
    out the real points concisely will prove an aid to clearer thinking.” The letter
    from Szilard and Einstein to FDR that was the catalyst for the Manhattan Project

    RStudio has a spell-checker built in, but Microsoft Word and Google Docs are useful
    additional checks. Copy from the Quarto document and paste into Word, then look
    for the red and green lines, and fix them in the Quarto document.

    are interested in grammar and sentence structure that occurs in conversational
    language use ([S. King 2000, 118](99-references.html#ref-stephenking)). The way
    to develop comfort is by reading widely and asking others to also read your work.
    Another useful tactic is to read your writing aloud, which can be useful for detecting
    odd sentences based on how they sound. One small aspect to check that will regularly
    come up is that any number from one to ten should be written as words, while 11
    and over should be written as numbers.
