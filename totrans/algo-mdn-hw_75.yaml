    *scan*, is a sequence of numbers $b_i$ generated from another sequence $a_i$ using

- en: Prefix sum is a very important primitive in many algorithms, especially in the
    context of parallel algorithms, where its computation scales almost perfectly
    with the number of processors. Unfortunately, it is much harder to speed up with
    SIMD parallelism on a single CPU core, but we will try it nonetheless — and derive
    an algorithm that is ~2.5x faster than the baseline scalar implementation.

    of the local prefix sums and the accumulation phase — so you usually split the
    array into as many blocks as you have processors. But since we are only allowed
    to use one CPU core, and [non-sequential memory access](/hpc/simd/moving#non-contiguous-load)

    as it is pretty much limited to executing one iteration per cycle regardless of
    the operand size, but it is still sort of “meh” when compared to some [other SIMD-based
    algorithms](../argmin). This is largely because there isn’t a full-register byte
    shift in AVX that would allow the `accumulate` stage to proceed twice as fast,
    let alone a dedicated prefix sum instruction.
