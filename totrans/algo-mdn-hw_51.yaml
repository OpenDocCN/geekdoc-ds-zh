    system: the number of cache layers, the [memory and block sizes](../hierarchy)

    is not the case for this and many similar divide-and-conquer algorithms. Although
    the iterative approach has the advantage of only doing sequential I/O, the recursive
    approach has much better temporal locality: when a segment fully fits into the
    cache, it stays there for all lower layers of recursion, resulting in better access
    times later on.'

    this happens, we would only need to read $O(\frac{N}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ blocks
    in total, while in the iterative approach the entire array will be read from scratch
    $O(\log N)$ times no matter what. This results in the speedup of $O(\frac{\log
    N}{\log N - \log M})$, which may be up to an order of magnitude.

    for this reason, it makes sense to use hybrid algorithms where we don’t go all
    the way down to the base case and instead switch to the iterative code on the
    lower levels of recursion.

    algorithms but leading to the reverse result. Consider the classic *knapsack problem:*
    given $N$ items with positive integer costs $c_i$, pick a subset of items with
    the maximum total cost that does not exceed a given constant $W$.
  prefs: []

    to the maximum total cost not exceeding $w$ that can be achieved using only the
    first $n$ items. These values can be computed in $O(1)$ time per entry if we consider
    either taking or not taking the $n$-th item and using the previous states of the
    dynamic to make the optimal decision.

    dynamic to store a binary value: whether it is possible to get the sum of exactly
