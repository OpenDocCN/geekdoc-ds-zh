- en: 3D friction is quite similar to its 2D counterpart, with the primary difference
    being the types of contact pairs involved. In 3D, these contact pairs are point-triangle
    and edge-edge pairs. Consequently, the barycentric coordinates of the closest
    points are now two-dimensional, represented by the optimal values of β1​ and β2​
    in the definitions provided in [Definition 24.1.1](lec24.1-barrier_and_dist.html#def:lec24:pt_dist)
    and [Definition 24.1.2](lec24.1-barrier_and_dist.html#def:lec24:ee_dist).

    the specific calculations adjust to account for the geometry of the contact pairs
    in 3D space.
