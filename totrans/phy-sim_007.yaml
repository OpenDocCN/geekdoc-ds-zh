- en: In contrast to explicit time integration, implicit time integration requires
    solving a system of equations to determine the values of \(x^{n+1}\) and \(v^{n+1}\).
    A notable benefit of this approach is its potential for greatly improved stability.
    The simplest form of implicit integration, the backward Euler method, is introduced
    as follows.

    Second Law).**** Given the current state variables, the mass matrix, and the time
    interval from \(t^n\) to \(t^{n+1}\), the update rules are as follows: xn+1vn+1​=xn+Δtvn+1,=vn+ΔtM−1fn+1,​(1.5.1)
    where \(n\) ranges from \(0,1,2,\dots\).'

    vectors \(x\). Thus, we can represent \(f^{n+1} = f(x^{n+1})\). It''s crucial
    to recognize that the update for \(x^{n+1}\) depends on knowing \(v^{n+1}\), yet
    the calculation of \(v^{n+1}\) is contingent on \(x^{n+1}\). This interdependence
    creates a cyclical dependency, necessitating the resolution of a system of equations
    to accurately find \(x^{n+1}\) and \(v^{n+1}\). By formulating \(v^{n+1} = (x^{n+1}
    - x^n) / \Delta t\), Equation [(1.5.1)](#eq:lec1:updateRule_implicit) can be rephrased
    as: M(xn+1−(xn+Δtvn))−Δt2f(xn+1)=0.(1.5.2) Given that forces \(f\) often exhibit
    nonlinearity with respect to positions \(x\), Equation [(1.5.2)](#eq:lec1:system_IE)
    generally becomes nonlinear, requiring the use of nonlinear root finding techniques
    like **Newton''s method** for solution.'

    As described in the algorithm below, Newton''s method is an iterative technique
    starting from an initial estimate \(x^i\) of the solution. At the current iteration
    \(x^i\), it linearly approximates \(f(x^{n+1}) \approx f(x^i) + (x^{n+1}-x^i)
    \nabla f(x^i)\), then resolves a linear system and updates the iteration. This
    process is repeated until a satisfactory degree of convergence is reached.'

- en: While the backward Euler method ensures **unconditional stability** even for
    large values of \(\Delta t\), it's crucial to recognize that increasing \(\Delta
    t\) may lead to poorer system conditioning. This complication can make solving
    the linear system more challenging. Additionally, it's important to remember that
    force linearization is an approximation. If the initial estimate for the solution
    is far from the actual solution, the standard iteration of Newton's method might
    not converge, and it could even diverge.

- en: In later discussions, we will introduce a modified version of Newton's method.
    This adaptation is designed to guarantee convergence for specific types of problems,
    regardless of the initial estimate or the size of \(\Delta t\).
