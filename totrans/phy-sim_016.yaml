    particularly in the Neo-Hookean model, does not always guarantee convergence.
    The presence of truncation errors, especially in scenarios involving large time
    steps or significant deformations, can adversely affect the convergence process.

- en: '**Example 3.1.1 (Illustration of Newton''s Convergence Issue).** To elucidate
    the issue of Newton''s method non-convergence, let''s consider a one-dimensional
    minimization problem characterized by the objective function: f(x)=ln(e−x+ex).
    We can evaluate the function at x=2 and approximate it using a quadratic energy
    g(x), which is defined as: g(x)=f(2)+f′(2)(x−2)+21​f′′(2)(x−2)2. The joint plot
    of f(x) and g(x) ([Figure 3.1.1](#fig:lec3:newton_issue_plot)) distinctly exhibits
    that the next iteration would exceed the actual target, landing at a point (x=−11.645)
    further from the actual solution at x=0. The subsequent iterations amplify this
    deviation, leading to a trajectory that diverges. It''s worth noting that this
    demonstration involves a convex function f(x)=ln(e−x+ex). The problem can become
    even more complex when Newton''s method is applied to non-convex elasticity energies.'

    by symmetric and positive-definite (SPD) second-order derivatives throughout their
    domain. Conversely, the energy in most models of nonlinear elasticity used in
    computer graphics is rotation invariant. This implies that the energy value remains
    unchanged regardless of the rotational orientation of objects or elements. Such
    rotation invariance leads to **non-convexity**, making the optimization process
    more complex.'

    an energy measure that enables the assurance of global convergence using a technique
    called line search.
