    it is at all time. For this purpose, it has an implanted location device that
    sends a signal to a tracking app.

    later on in this chapter. The dots are recorded locations at regular time intervals.
    The dotted line helps keep track of the time order of the recordings.

    One issue might be that the times at which the location is recorded are too far
    between. But, in fact, there is another issue: the tracking device is *inaccurate*.'

    the noise in the measurement as well as the dynamics itself. Probabilistic models
    are perfectly suited for this.

    take advantage of them to estimate unknown states (or parameters). In particular,
    conditional independence will play a key role.
