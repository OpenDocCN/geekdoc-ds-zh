    in [Case Study: 2D Self-Contact](./lec21-2d_self_contact.html). The executable
    Python project for this section can be found at [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial).'

- en: For simplicity, we will focus on implementing a semi-implicit version of friction.
    This means the normal force magnitude λ and the tangent operator T will be discretized
    to the last time step, and we solve the optimization once per time step without
    further fixed-point iterations that converge to solutions with fully-implicit
    friction ([Frictional Contact](./lec9-friction.html)) under the `8_self_friction`
    folder. [MUDA](https://github.com/MuGdxy/muda) GPU implementations can be found
    at [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu)
    under the `simulators/8_self_friction` folder. Combined with the smoothly approximated
    static-dynamic friction transition in IPC, implementing friction into an optimization
    time integration framework is as straightforward as adding an extra potential
    energy.
