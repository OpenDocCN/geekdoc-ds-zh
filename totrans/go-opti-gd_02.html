<p>The <strong>Go App Optimization Guide</strong> is a long-form series about making Go services faster in ways that actually translate to production. No folklore. No “best practices” without numbers. The focus is on understanding what the runtime is doing, where the costs come from, and how to reduce them without turning your codebase into a science experiment.</p>
<p>This guide is written for people running real systems. APIs under sustained traffic, background pipelines that move serious volume, and distributed services where tail latency matters. If your Go code runs only in benchmarks or toy projects, most of this will feel unnecessary. If it runs under load, it probably won’t.</p>
<p>Go deliberately hides much of its low-level control. You don’t get explicit memory management, and you don’t get to micromanage threads. What you do get is enough visibility to reason about allocations, scheduling, and I/O behavior. Combined with solid tooling, that’s usually sufficient to build fast, predictable systems. The articles in this series stay in that space. Practical leverage, not theoretical perfection.</p>
<p>The goal here is not cleverness. It’s boring code that stays fast when traffic spikes and doesn’t fall apart six months later.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-common-go-patterns-for-performance">Part 1. <a href="01-common-patterns/">Common Go Patterns for Performance</a><a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-common-go-patterns-for-performance" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section covers performance patterns that show up repeatedly in real Go codebases. Not exhaustive, not academic. Just the areas where small, disciplined changes tend to pay off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>sync.Pool</code> where it actually helps, not everywhere</li>
<li>Reducing allocation pressure on hot paths</li>
<li>Struct layout, padding, and why cache behavior still matters</li>
<li>Keeping error handling off the fast path</li>
<li>Interfaces without accidental indirection costs</li>
<li>Reusing slices and sorting in place instead of reallocating</li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete examples and measurements back each pattern. If there’s no observable impact, it doesn’t belong here.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-high-performance-networking-in-go">Part 2. <a href="02-networking/">High-Performance Networking in Go</a><a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-high-performance-networking-in-go" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This part focuses on networked services and the constraints that show up once concurrency stops being theoretical. The standard library gets you surprisingly far, but defaults are not magic. At scale, details matter.</p>
<p>Topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient use of <code>net/http</code>, <code>net.Conn</code>, and connection pools</li>
<li>Handling thousands of concurrent connections without resource collapse</li>
<li>Scheduler behavior, <code>GOMAXPROCS</code>, and OS-level mechanics like epoll and kqueue</li>
<li>Backpressure, load shedding, and failure containment</li>
<li>Avoiding memory leaks in long-lived connections</li>
<li>Trade-offs between TCP, HTTP/2, gRPC, and QUIC</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is intentionally more theoretical, but still grounded in tests and measurements where that’s possible. Networking behavior depends heavily on workload shape and environmental details, including kernel settings, network topology, deployment model, and hardware. Universal rules are rare. When conclusions rely on assumptions rather than guarantees, those assumptions are stated explicitly.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-tbd">Part 3. TBD<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3-tbd" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The scope is still being defined, but the direction is clear: runtime behavior under sustained load, profiling and observability that work in real systems, and failure modes that don’t show up in benchmarks. As with the rest of the guide, the emphasis will be on measured behavior and trade-offs, not generic advice.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-is-for">Who This Is For<a class="headerlink" href="#who-this-is-for" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This guide is aimed at engineers who care about how their Go programs behave after deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backend engineers running services where latency and throughput matter</li>
<li>Teams pushing Go into performance-critical paths</li>
<li>Developers who want to understand Go’s trade-offs instead of guessing</li>
<li>Anyone tired of profiling after incidents instead of before them</li>
</ul>
<p>More articles are coming. At the end, this is one of my favorite pet projects. As the series grows, it will stay focused on applied performance work rather than abstract tuning advice. If that’s useful to you, bookmark it and come back later.</p>
