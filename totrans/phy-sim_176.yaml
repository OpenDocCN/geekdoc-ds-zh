- en: Direct solvers are a class of algorithms designed to compute the exact solution
    to a linear system in a finite number of steps, up to numerical precision. In
    the context of optimization and simulation, the coefficient matrix A is often
    symmetric positive definite (SPD), making direct solvers both robust and efficient
    for moderate-sized problems.

    the Cholesky decomposition. Given A SPD, we can factor A=LLT, where L is lower
    triangular.

- en: Cholesky decomposition takes advantage of the symmetry and positive definiteness
    of A, reducing both computational cost and memory usage compared to general-purpose
    methods like LU decomposition. Direct solvers are widely used when the system
    size is not too large, or when high accuracy is required for ill-conditioned systems.
    For very large or highly sparse systems, iterative solvers may be preferred, as
    discussed in the next section.
