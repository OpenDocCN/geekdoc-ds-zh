Both floating-point and integer division is notoriously hard to implement in hardware. The circuitry takes a lot of space in the ALU, the computation has a lot of stages, and as the result, <code>div</code> and its siblings routinely take 10-20 cycles to complete, with latency being slightly less on smaller data type sizes.</p><span class="anchor" id="division-and-modulo-in-x86"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/arithmetic/division/#division-and-modulo-in-x86">#</a>Division and Modulo in x86</h3><p>Since nobody wants to duplicate all this mess for a separate modulo operation, the <code>div</code> instruction serves both purposes. To perform a 32-bit integer division, you need to put the dividend <em>specifically</em> in the <code>eax</code> register and call <code>div</code> with the divisor as its sole operand. After this, the quotient will be stored in <code>eax</code> and the remainder will be stored in <code>edx</code>.</p><p>The only caveat is that the dividend actually needs to be stored in <em>two</em> registers, <code>eax</code> and <code>edx</code>: this mechanism enables 64-by-32 or even 128-by-64 division, similar to how <a href="../integer">128-bit multiplication</a> works. When performing the usual 32-by-32 signed division, we need to sign-extend <code>eax</code> to 64 bits and store its higher part in <code>edx</code>:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">div</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">int</span><span class="p">):</span>

Because of this constraint, it is <a href="https://danlark.org/2020/06/14/128-bit-division/">hard</a> to get compilers to produce this code by themselves: if you divide a <a href="../integer">128-bit integer type</a> by a 64-bit integer, the compiler will bubble-wrap it with additional checks which may actually be unnecessary.</p><span class="anchor" id="division-by-constants"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/arithmetic/division/#division-by-constants">#</a>Division by Constants</h3><p>Integer division is painfully slow, even when fully implemented in hardware, but it can be avoided in certain cases if the divisor is constant. A well-known example is the division by a power of two, which can be replaced by a one-cycle binary shift: the <a href="/hpc/algorithms/gcd">binary GCD algorithm</a> is a delightful showcase of this technique.</p><p>In the general case, there are several clever tricks that replace division with multiplication at the cost of a bit of precomputation. All these tricks are based on the following idea. Consider the task of dividing one floating-point number $x$ by another floating-point number $y$, when $y$ is known in advance. What we can do is to calculate a constant</p>$$
d \approx y^{-1}
$$
and then, during runtime, we will calculate
$$
x / y = x \cdot y^{-1} \approx x \cdot d
$$<p>The result of $\frac{1}{y}$ will be at most $\epsilon$ off, and the multiplication $x \cdot d$ will only add another $\epsilon$ and therefore will be at most $2 \epsilon + \epsilon^2 = O(\epsilon)$ off, which is tolerable for the floating-point case.</p><span class="anchor" id="barrett-reduction"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/arithmetic/division/#barrett-reduction">#</a>Barrett Reduction</h3><p>How to generalize this trick for integers? Calculating <code>int d = 1 / y</code> doesn’t seem to work, because it will just be zero. The best thing we can do is to express it as</p>$$
d = \frac{m}{2^s}
$$
and then find a “magic” number $m$ and a binary shift $s$ such that <code>x / y == (x * m) &gt;&gt; s</code> for all <code>x</code> within range.
$$
\lfloor x / y \rfloor
= \lfloor x \cdot y^{-1} \rfloor
= \lfloor x \cdot d \rfloor
= \lfloor x \cdot \frac{m}{2^s} \rfloor
$$<p>It can be shown that such a pair always exists, and compilers actually perform an optimization like that by themselves. Every time they encounter a division by a constant, they replace it with a multiplication and a binary shift. Here is the generated assembly for dividing an <code>unsigned long long</code> by $(10^9 + 7)$:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">;  input (rdi): x</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This technique is called <em>Barrett reduction</em>, and it’s called “reduction” because it is mostly used for modulo operations, which can be replaced with a single division, multiplication and subtraction by the virtue of this formula:</p>$$
r = x - \lfloor x / y \rfloor \cdot y
$$<p>This method requires some precomputation, including performing one actual division. Therefore, this is only beneficial when you perform not just one but a few divisions, all with the same constant divisor.</p><span class="anchor" id="why-it-works"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/arithmetic/division/#why-it-works">#</a>Why It Works</h3><p>It is not very clear why such $m$ and $s$ always exist, let alone how to find them. But given a fixed $s$, intuition tells us that $m$ should be as close to $2^s/y$ as possible for $2^s$ to cancel out. So there are two natural choices: $\lfloor 2^s/y \rfloor$ and $\lceil 2^s/y \rceil$. The first one doesn’t work, because if you substitute</p>$$
\Bigl \lfloor \frac{x \cdot \lfloor 2^s/y \rfloor}{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
$$
then for any integer $\frac{x}{y}$ where $y$ is not even, the result will be strictly less than the truth. This only leaves the other case, $m = \lceil 2^s/y \rceil$. Now, let’s try to derive the lower and upper bounds for the result of the computation:
$$
\lfloor x / y \rfloor
= \Bigl \lfloor \frac{x \cdot m}{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
= \Bigl \lfloor \frac{x \cdot \lceil 2^s /y \rceil}{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
$$
Let’s start with the bounds for $m$:
$$
2^s / y
\le
\lceil 2^s / y \rceil
&lt;
2^s / y + 1
$$
And now for the whole expression:
$$
x / y - 1
&lt;
\Bigl \lfloor \frac{x \cdot \lceil 2^s /y \rceil}{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
&lt;
x / y + x / 2^s
$$<p>We can see that the result falls somewhere in a range of size $(1 + \frac{x}{2^s})$, and if this range always has exactly one integer for all possible $x / y$, then the algorithm is guaranteed to give the right answer. Turns out, we can always set $s$ to be high enough to achieve it.</p><p>What will be the worst case here? How to pick $x$ and $y$ so that the $(x/y - 1, x/y + x / 2^s)$ range contains two integers? We can see that integer ratios don’t work because the left border is not included, and assuming $x/2^s &lt; 1$, only $x/y$ itself will be in the range. The worst case is actually the $x/y$ that comes closest to $1$ without exceeding it. For $n$-bit integers, that is the second-largest possible integer divided by the first-largest:</p>$$
\begin{aligned}
x = 2^n - 2
\\ y = 2^n - 1
\end{aligned}
$$<p>In this case, the lower bound will be $(\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1} - 1)$ and the upper bound will be $(\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1} + \frac{2^n-2}{2^s})$. The left border is as close to a whole number as possible, and the size of the whole range is the second largest possible. And here is the punchline: if $s \ge n$, then the only integer contained in this range is $1$, and so the algorithm will always return it.</p><span class="anchor" id="lemire-reduction"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/arithmetic/division/#lemire-reduction">#</a>Lemire Reduction</h3><p>Barrett reduction is a bit complicated, and also generates a length instruction sequence for modulo because it is computed indirectly. There is a new (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01961.pdf">2019</a>) method, which is simpler and actually faster for modulo in some cases. It doesn’t have a conventional name yet, but I am going to refer to it as <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/">Lemire</a> reduction.</p><p>Here is the main idea. Consider the floating-point representation of some integer fraction:</p>$$
\frac{179}{6} = 11101.1101010101\ldots = 29\tfrac{5}{6} \approx 29.83
$$<p>How can we “dissect” it to get the parts we need?</p><ul><li>To get the integer part (29), we can just floor or truncate it before the dot.</li><li>To get the fractional part (⅚), we can just take what is after the dots.</li><li>To get the remainder (5), we can multiply the fractional part by the divisor.</li></ul><p>Now, for 32-bit integers, we can set $s = 64$ and look at the computation that we do in the multiply-and-shift scheme:</p>$$
\lfloor x / y \rfloor
= \Bigl \lfloor \frac{x \cdot m}{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
= \Bigl \lfloor \frac{x \cdot \lceil 2^s /y \rceil}{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
$$<p>What we really do here is we multiply $x$ by a floating-point constant ($x \cdot m$) and then truncate the result $(\lfloor \frac{\cdot}{2^s} \rfloor)$.</p><p>What if we took not the highest bits but the lowest? This would correspond to the fractional part — and if we multiply it back by $y$ and truncate the result, this will be exactly the remainder:</p>$$
r = \Bigl \lfloor \frac{ (x \cdot \lceil 2^s /y \rceil \bmod 2^s) \cdot y }{2^s} \Bigr \rfloor
$$<p>This works perfectly because what we do here can be interpreted as just three chained floating-point multiplications with the total relative error of $O(\epsilon)$. Since $\epsilon = O(\frac{1}{2^s})$ and $s = 2n$, the error will always be less than one, and hence the result will be exact.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kt">uint32_t</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
