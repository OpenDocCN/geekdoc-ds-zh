- en: The 2020 socio-demographic report on the German state North-Rhine Westphalia
    continues the state’s social reporting since its beginning in 1992\. These reports
    aim to provide the public with information on the social and demographic conditions
    and dynamics of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).

    figures, the proportion of people with a migration background), the economy (e.g.,
    unemployment rates, GDP), health, education, housing, public finances, and social

    Insights from data analyses may provide politicians and public officials with
    information on social problems that need to be addressed by political measures.
    It is thus important that interpretations derived from data analyses are accurate.
    In the following case study, we take a closer look at the data and use methods
    from univariate statistics. Please note that the analyses and interpretations
    below are meant to illustrate data analysis techniques and do not reflect any

    R uses a lot of so-called “packages” (i.e., software add-ons that facilitate or
    simplify specific parts of data analysis). For example, the package “readxl” allows
    us to read data that is stored in an Excel format. As another example, the package
    “ggplot2” allows us to create print-ready figures. Packages often have a specific
    syntax to which we refer along the way.

    the center of the distrubtion or are they widely spread?). Histograms show the
    frequency of observations across the range of values of a variable. It does not
    matter how the single observations (i.e., districts in our case) appear in the
    data set. The histogram ranks observations depending on the values they have on
    a specific variable. The height of the displayed bars is proportional to the frequency
    of observations that have corresponding variable values. The width of the bars
    (also known as bins) represents an interval of values and can be customized (i.e.,
    a few wide bars comprise more observations than many narrow ones).

    available but also a report from another German state. Comparing county characteristics,
    such as crime rates, across the two states might result in finding that both have
    the exact same mean. However, the crime rate in State 1 is much more extremely
    distributed, with particularly high and low values for some counties. In State
    2, in contrast, the crime rate is much more evenly distributed around the mean.
    Determining the degree of dispersion (or scatteredness) of data is an important
    piece of information that is useful for several further statistical analyses It
    might also yield practical relevance, as different patterns of dispersion of crime
    may lead to different policy measures for combating crime. Let us start with calculating

    The correlation is also statistically significant (we typically speak of a statistically
    significant result if the p-value is below 0.05), which means that we can be fairly
    certain that the result is not due to chance but can be interpreted as systematic**.*'

- en: The correlation showed that there is a positive (and statistically significant)
    bivariate relationship between unemployment and crime. But is this relationship
    causal? One way to assess this is to control for alternative explanations using
    multiple regression. We use population density as an alternative explanation.
    After all, it may well be that unemployment and crime occur primarily in an urban
    context. If that was the case, part of the correlation would not be due to unemployment,
    but to population density, and unemployment would so to say partly “transport”
    the effect of population density (if not included in the regression model). Let’s
    take a look at this.

- en: '***Interpretation: If unemployment increases by one percentage point, crime
    increases by 517 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (Model 1). The relationship is
    statistically significant. If we now control for population density in Model 2
    (and thus hold the influence of population density constant), a one-unit increase
    in unemployment is associated with an increase of only 215 cases. Population density
    is also positively associated with crime. Both coefficient estimates are statistically
    significant at p < 0.01. It thus seems to be a good idea to control for the influence
    of population density. We might be now much closer to the real effect of unemployment
    on crime now. However, we do not know this for certain because other alternative
    explanations are still possible to think of (e.g., the role of age composition
    or local social policies, as well as alternative explanations at the level of
    individuals)**.*'
