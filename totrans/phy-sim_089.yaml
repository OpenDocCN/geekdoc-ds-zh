- en: Until now, we've omitted the Dirichlet boundary conditions and frictional contact
    in both the strong and weak forms of the governing equations to keep the derivations
    concise and straightforward. However, as we learned in the Boundary Treatments
    chapter, this boundary information is crucial for accurately simulating a wide
    range of solid dynamics.
