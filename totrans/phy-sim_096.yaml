    Here, we assume that the world space coordinates of any arbitrary point in an
    element can be interpolated solely from the coordinates of the element's vertices.

    resulting in a piecewise linear (per triangle) displacement field u=x^(X)−X over
    the entire domain. Before providing the precise expression of N in terms of X,
    we'll introduce another parameter space to simplify the derivation.

    the **partition of unity** everywhere within each element: N1​(β,γ)+N2​(β,γ)+N3​(β,γ)=1∀ β,γ∈[0,1] and β+γ≤1.
    One advantage of FEM is that it provides accurate boundary resolution compared
    to grid or particle-based representations. The boundary nodes of the FEM mesh
    can be exactly located on the boundary of the continuous domain. The elements
    are generated inside the domain, connecting the boundary nodes to form the discrete
    boundary, which converges to the boundary of the continuous domain as resolution
    increases.'

- en: Although particle-based methods can also sample particles on the domain boundary,
    their spherical shape functions extend beyond the domain, breaking the partition
    of unity. This creates a "soft" outbound layer of material that makes boundary
    force computations inaccurate. In contrast, FEM shape functions are nonzero only
    within each element, where the partition of unity is satisfied everywhere.
