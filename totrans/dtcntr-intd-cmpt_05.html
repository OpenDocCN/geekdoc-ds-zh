Anytime you
write the (shorthand) <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">NAME</code>, Pyret will automatically (behind the
scenes) replace it with the value of <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">EXPRESSION</code>. For example,
if you write <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">x = 5 + 4</code> at the prompt, then write <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">x</code>, CPO will give

when an expression contains a name that has not been associated with
(or bound to) a value.</p><section class="SsectionLevel5" id="section 3.2.2.1"><h5 class="heading">3.2.2.1 <a name="(part._naming-strings)"/>Names Versus Strings<a href="#(part._naming-strings)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h5><p>At this point, we have seen words being used in two ways in
programming: (1) as data within strings and (2) as names for
values (also called identifiers). These are two very different
uses, so it is worth reviewing them.</p><ul><li><p>Syntactically (another way of saying “in terms of how we write it”), we
distinguish strings and names by the presence of double quotation
marks. Note the difference between <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">puppy</code> and <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"puppy"</code>.</p></li><li><p>Strings can contain spaces, but names cannot. For example,
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"hot pink"</code> is a valid piece of data, but <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">hot pink</code> is not
a single name. When you want to combine multiple words into a name
(like we did above with <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">red-circ</code>), use a hyphen to separate
the words while still having a single name (as a sequence of
characters). Different programming languages allow different
separators; for Pyret, we’ll use hyphens.</p></li><li><p>Entering a word as a name versus as a string at the interactions
prompt changes the computation that you are asking Pyret to
perform. If you enter <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">puppy</code> (the name, without double quotes),
you are asking Pyret to lookup the value that you previously stored
under that name. If you enter <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"puppy"</code> (the string, with double
quotes) you are simply writing down a piece of data (akin to typing a
number like <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">3</code>): Pyret returns the value you
entered as the result of the computation. </p></li><li><p>If you enter a name that you have not previously associated with
a value, Pyret will give you an “unbound identifier” error
message. In contrast, since strings are just data, you won’t get an
error for writing a previously-unused string (there are some special
cases of strings, such as when you want to put a quotation mark inside
them, but we’ll set that aside for now).</p></li></ul><p>Novice programmers frequently confuse names and strings at first. For
now, remember that the names you associate with values using <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">=</code>
cannot contain quotation marks, while word- or text-based data must
be wrapped in double quotes.</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel5" id="section 3.2.2.2"><h5 class="heading">3.2.2.2 <a name="(part._naming-expr-statements)"/>Expressions versus
Statements<a href="#(part._naming-expr-statements)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h5><p>Definitions and expressions are two useful aspects of programs, each
with their own role. Definitions tell Pyret to associate names with
values. Expressions tell Pyret to perform a computation and return
the result.</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Enter each of the following at the interactions prompt:</p><ul><li><p><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">5 + 8</code></p></li><li><p><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">x = 14 + 16</code></p></li><li><p><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">triangle(20, "solid", "purple")</code></p></li><li><p><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">blue-circ = circle(x, "solid", "blue")</code></p></li></ul><p>The first and third are expressions, while the second and fourth are

expressions versus the results of entering definitions?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Hopefully, you notice that Pyret doesn’t seem to return anything from
the definitions, but it does display a value from the
expressions. In programming, we distinguish expressions, which yield values,
from statements, which don’t yield values but instead give some
other kind of instruction to the language. So far,
definitions are the only kinds of statements we’ve seen.</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Assuming you still have the <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">blue-circ</code> definition from above in

expression or a definition?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Since <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">blue-circ</code> yielded a result, we infer that a name by
itself is also an expression. This exercise highlights the difference
between making a definition and using a defined name. One produces a
value while the other does not. But surely something must
happen, somewhere, when you run a definition. Otherwise, how
could you use that name later?</p></section></section><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 3.2.3"><h4 class="heading">3.2.3 <a name="(part._program-directory)"/>The Program Directory<a href="#(part._program-directory)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>Programming tools do work behind the scenes as they run
programs. Given the program <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">2 + 3</code>, for example, a calculation
takes place to produce <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">5</code>, which in turn displays in the
interactions pane.</p><p>When you write a definition, Pyret makes an entry in an internal
directory in which it associates names with values. You can’t
see the directory, but Pyret uses it to manage the values that you’ve
associated with names. If you write:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width = 30</code></pre><p>Pyret makes a new directory entry for <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code> and records that
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code> has value <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30</code>. If you then write
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height = width * 3</code></pre><p>Pyret evaluates the expression on the right side
(<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width * 3</code>), then stores the resulting value (here, <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code>)
alongside <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code> in the directory.</p><p>How does Pyret evaluate (<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width * 3</code>)? Since <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code> is a
word (not a string), Pyret looks up its value in the directory. Pyret
substitutes that value for the name in the expression, resulting in
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30 * 3</code>, which then evaluates to <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code>. After running
these two expressions, the directory looks like:
</p><p>Directory</p><ul><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code></pre><p> → </p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30</code></pre></li><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code></pre><p> → </p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code></pre></li></ul><p>Note that the entry for <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code> in the directory has the
result of <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width * 3</code>, not the expression. This will
become important as we use named values to prevent us from doing the
same computation more than once.</p><p>The program directory is an essential part of how programs
evaluate. If you are trying to track how your program is working, it
sometimes helps to track the directory contents on a sheet of paper
(since you can’t view Pyret’s directory).</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Imagine that you have the following code in the definitions pane
when you press the Run button:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">name = "Matthias"

you about the directory?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>When you try to give a new value to a name that is already in the
directory, Pyret will respond that the new definition “conflicts with an earlier declaration of the same name”. This is Pyret’s way of
warning you that the name is already in the directory. If you ask for
the value associated with the name again, you’ll see that it still has
the original value. Pyret doesn’t let you change the value associated
with an existing name with the <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">name = value</code> notation. While
there is a notation that will let you reassign values, we won’t work
with this concept until <a href="mutating-variables.html" data-pltdoc="x">Mutating Variables</a>.</p><section class="SsectionLevel5" id="section 3.2.3.1"><h5 class="heading">3.2.3.1 <a name="(part._.Understanding_the_.Run_.Button)"/>Understanding the Run Button<a href="#(part._.Understanding_the_.Run_.Button)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h5><p>Now that we’ve learned about the program directory, let’s discuss what happens when you

height = width * 3
blue-rect = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "blue")</code></pre><p>When you press Run, Pyret first clears out the program directory. It
then processes your file line by line, starting at the top. If you
have an <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">include</code> statement, Pyret adds the definitions from the
included library to the directory. After processing all of the lines
for this program, the directory will look like:</p><p>Directory</p><ul><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">circle</code></pre><p> → &lt;the circle operation&gt;</p></li><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">rectangle</code></pre><p> → &lt;the rectangle operation&gt;</p></li><li><p>...</p></li><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code></pre><p> → </p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30</code></pre></li><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code></pre><p> → </p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code></pre></li><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">blue-rect</code></pre><p> → &lt;the actual rectangle image&gt;</p></li></ul><p>If you now type at the interactions prompt, any use of an identifier

wrote the following (at the interactions prompt)?</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">two-rects = beside(blue-rect, rectangle(20, 20, "solid", "purple"))</code></pre><p>Now, the two-shape image would be in the directory, associated with
the name <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">two-rects</code>. The purple rectangle by itself, however,
still would not be stored in the directory. We could, however,
reference the two-shape image by name, as shown below:</p><p><img src="../Images/e7e9adaeb80f562aba2a5a84943485b7.png" alt="" width="982" height="239" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/run-demo.png"/></p><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>Imagine that we now hit the Run button again, then typed

green-sqr = rectangle(60, 60, "solid", "green")

ones that will get used more than once, or ones that have particular

<h5 class="heading">3.2.2.1 <a name="(part._naming-strings)"/>Names Versus Strings<a href="#(part._naming-strings)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h5><p>At this point, we have seen words being used in two ways in
programming: (1) as data within strings and (2) as names for
values (also called identifiers). These are two very different
uses, so it is worth reviewing them.</p><ul><li><p>Syntactically (another way of saying “in terms of how we write it”), we
distinguish strings and names by the presence of double quotation
marks. Note the difference between <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">puppy</code> and <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"puppy"</code>.</p></li><li><p>Strings can contain spaces, but names cannot. For example,
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"hot pink"</code> is a valid piece of data, but <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">hot pink</code> is not
a single name. When you want to combine multiple words into a name
(like we did above with <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">red-circ</code>), use a hyphen to separate
the words while still having a single name (as a sequence of
characters). Different programming languages allow different
separators; for Pyret, we’ll use hyphens.</p></li><li><p>Entering a word as a name versus as a string at the interactions
prompt changes the computation that you are asking Pyret to
perform. If you enter <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">puppy</code> (the name, without double quotes),
you are asking Pyret to lookup the value that you previously stored
under that name. If you enter <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"puppy"</code> (the string, with double
quotes) you are simply writing down a piece of data (akin to typing a
number like <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">3</code>): Pyret returns the value you
entered as the result of the computation. </p></li><li><p>If you enter a name that you have not previously associated with
a value, Pyret will give you an “unbound identifier” error
message. In contrast, since strings are just data, you won’t get an
error for writing a previously-unused string (there are some special
cases of strings, such as when you want to put a quotation mark inside
them, but we’ll set that aside for now).</p></li></ul><p>Novice programmers frequently confuse names and strings at first. For
now, remember that the names you associate with values using <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">=</code>
cannot contain quotation marks, while word- or text-based data must
be wrapped in double quotes.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="heading">3.2.3 <a name="(part._program-directory)"/>The Program Directory<a href="#(part._program-directory)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>Programming tools do work behind the scenes as they run
programs. Given the program <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">2 + 3</code>, for example, a calculation
takes place to produce <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">5</code>, which in turn displays in the
interactions pane.</p><p>When you write a definition, Pyret makes an entry in an internal
directory in which it associates names with values. You can’t
see the directory, but Pyret uses it to manage the values that you’ve
associated with names. If you write:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width = 30</code></pre><p>Pyret makes a new directory entry for <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code> and records that
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code> has value <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30</code>. If you then write
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height = width * 3</code></pre><p>Pyret evaluates the expression on the right side
(<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width * 3</code>), then stores the resulting value (here, <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code>)
alongside <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code> in the directory.</p><p>How does Pyret evaluate (<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width * 3</code>)? Since <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code> is a
word (not a string), Pyret looks up its value in the directory. Pyret
substitutes that value for the name in the expression, resulting in
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30 * 3</code>, which then evaluates to <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code>. After running
these two expressions, the directory looks like:
</p><p>Directory</p><ul><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width</code></pre><p> → </p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">30</code></pre></li><li><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code></pre><p> → </p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">90</code></pre></li></ul><p>Note that the entry for <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">height</code> in the directory has the
result of <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">width * 3</code>, not the expression. This will
become important as we use named values to prevent us from doing the
same computation more than once.</p><p>The program directory is an essential part of how programs
evaluate. If you are trying to track how your program is working, it
sometimes helps to track the directory contents on a sheet of paper
(since you can’t view Pyret’s directory).</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Imagine that you have the following code in the definitions pane

you about the directory?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>When you try to give a new value to a name that is already in the
directory, Pyret will respond that the new definition “conflicts with an earlier declaration of the same name”. This is Pyret’s way of
warning you that the name is already in the directory. If you ask for
the value associated with the name again, you’ll see that it still has
the original value. Pyret doesn’t let you change the value associated
with an existing name with the <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">name = value</code> notation. While
