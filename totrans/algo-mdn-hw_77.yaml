- en: 'Optimizing data structures is different from optimizing [algorithms](/hpc/algorithms)
    as data structure problems have more dimensions: you may be optimizing for *throughput*,
    for *latency*, for *memory usage*, or any combination of those — and this complexity
    blows up exponentially when you need to process *multiple* query types and consider
    multiple query distributions.'

    let alone the actual implementations. In this chapter, we will try to navigate
    all this complexity and learn how to design efficient data structures with extensive
    case studies.
