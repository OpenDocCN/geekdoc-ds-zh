- en: Boundary treatments, including boundary conditions and frictional contacts,
    play a crucial role in solid simulations. They not only enhance the expressiveness
    of scene setup but also capture intricate dynamics within the simulation. This
    lecture introduces Dirichlet boundary conditions, a pivotal concept for prescribing
    the motion of specific nodes in solid structures. Understanding these conditions
    is essential for accurately modeling and manipulating the behavior of solids in
    various simulation scenarios.
