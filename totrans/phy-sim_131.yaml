- en: This lecture explores how subspace methods can be leveraged to extend the IPC
    framework to rigid and near-rigid body simulations effectively. The key idea is
    to reduce the system's degrees of freedom (DOFs) by projecting the high-dimensional
    deformable body dynamics into a lower-dimensional subspace that still captures
    essential behavior.

- en: Rigid body dynamics are introduced from Newtonian mechanics, resulting in the
    standard equations governing linear and angular momentum evolution. Integration
    schemes for solving these equations are reviewed, with quaternions used for rotation
    tracking.

    is proposed as a compromise between rigid and deformable models, allowing for
    minimal affine deformation while maintaining computational efficiency. The ABD
    formulation benefits from linear dependence of vertex positions on the Projected
    Newton optimization step size, enabling effective use of linear CCD for collision
    resolution in IPC.

- en: The ABD model allows simulation using significantly fewer DOFs by driving high-resolution
    collision geometry via low-resolution affine embeddings (e.g., triangle-driven
    motion in 2D). IPC gradients and Hessians are projected through the Jacobian to
    solve the reduced system in the subspace, leading to faster and more stable simulations
    for complex scenes with many rigid-like bodies and dense contacts.
