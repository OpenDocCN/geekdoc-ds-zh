- en: This section introduces Position Based Dynamics (PBD). In the field of physical
    simulation, several dominant paradigms exist, each with a different level of abstraction
    for describing motion.

- en: The most classical approach is force-based, which directly models Newton's second
    law. In a force-based paradigm, internal and external forces are accumulated to
    determine particle accelerations, which are then numerically integrated to find
    new velocities and positions. While physically accurate, these methods can suffer
    from expensive computational costs due to the solution of large nonlinear systems.

- en: Position-based methods bypass the velocity and acceleration layers altogether,
    working immediately on the positions of particles. The central idea is to define
    the system's behavior through a set of geometric constraints. The simulation loop
    first predicts a new position for each particle based on its current velocity.
    Then, an iterative solver adjusts these predicted positions directly to ensure
    that all constraints are satisfied. This process of constraint projection replaces
    the explicit integration of forces, leading to highly efficient and visually plausible
    simulations, which makes PBD an effective alternative to classical dynamics frameworks.
