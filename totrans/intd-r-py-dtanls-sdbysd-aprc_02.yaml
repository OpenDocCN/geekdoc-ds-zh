- en: This book is written to be used in a computing class that teaches both R and
    Python to graduate students in a statistics or data science department. This book
    is written for students that do not necessarily possess any previous familiarity
    with writing code.

- en: If you are using them for analyzing data, R and Python do a lot of the same
    things in pretty similar ways, so it does not always make sense to either a.)
    teach one language after the other, or b.) choose one over the other. The side-by-side
    approach helps to teach/learn more, save time, and reinforce shared concepts and
    key differences.

- en: This text does not describe statistical modeling techniques in detail, but many
    exercises will ask students to implement them. These exercises will not assume
    mathematical familiarity. The objective is to test programming ability, and an
    added benefit is that the work might be useful later in their careers.

- en: This book is written for aspiring data scientists, not necessarily aspiring
    software developers. Why do I draw the distinction? When discussing different
    types, for example, I do not discuss data structures in any depth. Rather, I discuss
    examples of applications where different types would be most useful.

- en: Generally speaking, chapters should be read in order, but occasionally skipping
    ahead can be beneficial. Later chapters are more may assume some familiarity with
    previous chapters. Also, within a chapter’s section, sometimes a discussion for
    a particular topic in Python, say, might follow a discussion about the same topic
    in R. In this case, the later section will often assume that the previous section
    has been read first.

- en: Sometimes R and Python code look very similar, or even identical. This is why
    I usually separate R and Python code into separate sections. However, sometimes
    I do not, so whenever it is necessary to prevent confusion, I will remind you
    what language is being used in comments (more about comments in [1.2](/intro#hello-world-in-python)
    ).

- en: To get started, you must install both R and Python. The installation process
    depends on what kind of machine you have (e.g. what type of operating system your
    machine is running, is your processor \(32\) or \(64\) bit, etc.).

- en: 'Below, I suggest running R with RStudio, and Python with Anaconda, and I provide
    some helpful links. I suggest downloading these two bundles separately; however,
    I should note that the recommendation below is not the only installation method.
    For example: - one can run R and Python without downloading RStudio or Anaconda,
    - one can install RStudio with Anaconda, - one can run Python from within Rstudio,
    - one can run Python from within Rstudio that is managed by Anaconda, etc., and
    - options and procedures are very likely to change over time.'

- en: Instructors can prefer alternative strategies, if they wish. If they do, they
    should verify that Python’s version is `>=3.6`, and R’s is `>=4.0.0`. If so, all
    the code in this book should run.

    is a graphical user interface with many tools that making writing R easier and

    manager, and Python distribution with many third party open source packages. It
    provides a graphical user interface for us, too, just as RStudio does. You can
    access instructions for your specific machine and OS by clicking [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#).
