    time. To achieve this on computers, both geometry and time must be represented
    discretely.

    to calculate temporal derivatives of physical quantities, in line with Newton's

- en: The Forward Euler method is generally avoided due to its unconditional instability.
    Conversely, the Symplectic Euler method is explicit and conditionally stable,
    often preferred for well-conditioned problems. For stiff problems, the Backward
    Euler method, unconditionally stable but requiring the resolution of nonlinear
    equation systems, is commonly used despite its computational intensity and potential
    for numerical instability.
