<p>When optimizing Go programs for performance, struct layout and memory alignment often go unnoticed—yet they have a measurable impact on memory usage and cache efficiency. Go automatically aligns struct fields based on platform-specific rules, inserting padding to satisfy alignment constraints. Understanding and controlling memory alignment isn’t just a low-level detail—it can have a real impact on how your Go programs perform, especially in tight loops or high-throughput systems. Proper alignment can reduce the overall memory footprint, make better use of CPU caches, and eliminate subtle performance penalties that add up under load.</p>
<h2 id="why-alignment-matters">Why Alignment Matters<a class="headerlink" href="#why-alignment-matters" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modern CPUs are tuned for predictable memory access. When struct fields are misaligned or split across cache lines, the processor often has to do extra work to fetch the data. That can mean additional memory cycles, more cache misses, and slower performance overall. These costs are easy to overlook in everyday code but show up quickly in code that’s sensitive to throughput or latency. In Go, struct fields are aligned according to their type requirements, and the compiler inserts padding bytes to meet these constraints. If fields are arranged without care, unnecessary padding may inflate struct size significantly, affecting memory use and bandwidth.</p>
<p>Consider the following two structs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>type PoorlyAligned struct {
    flag bool
    count int64
    id byte
}

type WellAligned struct {
    count int64
    flag bool
    id byte
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>On a 64-bit system, <code>PoorlyAligned</code> requires 24 bytes due to the padding between fields, whereas <code>WellAligned</code> fits into 16 bytes by ordering fields from largest to smallest alignment requirement.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-impact">Benchmarking Impact<a class="headerlink" href="#benchmarking-impact" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>We benchmarked both struct layouts by allocating 10 million instances of each and measuring allocation time and memory usage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>func BenchmarkPoorlyAligned(b *testing.B) {
    for b.Loop() {
        var items = make([]PoorlyAligned, 10_000_000)
        for j := range items {
            items[j].count = int64(j)
        }
    }
}

func BenchmarkWellAligned(b *testing.B) {
    for b.Loop() {
        var items = make([]WellAligned, 10_000_000)
        for j := range items {
            items[j].count = int64(j)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a test with 10 million structs, the <code>WellAligned</code> version used 80MB less memory than its poorly aligned counterpart—and it also ran a bit faster. This isn’t just about saving RAM; it shows how struct layout directly affects allocation behavior and memory bandwidth. When you’re working with large volumes of data or performance-critical paths, reordering fields for better alignment can lead to measurable gains with minimal effort.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-false-sharing-in-concurrent-workloads">Avoiding False Sharing in Concurrent Workloads<a class="headerlink" href="#avoiding-false-sharing-in-concurrent-workloads" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to memory layout efficiency, struct alignment also plays a crucial role in concurrent systems. When multiple goroutines access different fields of the same struct that reside on the same CPU cache line, they may suffer from false sharing—where changes to one field cause invalidations in the other, even if logically unrelated.</p>
<p>On modern CPUs, a typical cache line is 64 bytes wide. When a struct is accessed in memory, the CPU loads the entire cache line that contains it, not just the specific field. This means that two unrelated fields within the same 64-byte block will both reside in the same line—even if they are used independently by separate goroutines. If one goroutine writes to its field, the cache line becomes invalidated and must be reloaded on the other core, leading to degraded performance due to false sharing.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we compared two structs—one vulnerable to false sharing, and another with padding to separate fields across cache lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>type SharedCounterBad struct {
    a int64
    b int64
}

type SharedCounterGood struct {
    a int64
    _ [56]byte // Padding to prevent a and b from sharing a cache line
    b int64
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each field is incremented by a separate goroutine 1 million times:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>func BenchmarkFalseSharing(b *testing.B) {
    var c SharedCounterBad  // (1)
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for b.Loop() {
        wg.Add(2)
        go func() {
            for i := 0; i &lt; 1_000_000; i++ {
                c.a++
            }
            wg.Done()
        }()
        go func() {
            for i := 0; i &lt; 1_000_000; i++ {
                c.b++
            }
            wg.Done()
        }()
        wg.Wait()
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li><code>FalseSharing</code> and <code>NoFalseSharing</code> benchmarks are identical, except we will use <code>SharedCounterGood</code> for the <code>NoFalseSharing</code> benchmark.</li>
</ol>
<p>Benchmark Results:</p>

<p>Placing padding between the two fields prevented false sharing, resulting in a measurable performance improvement. The version with padding completed ~3.8% faster (the value could vary between re-runs from 3% to 6%), which can make a difference in tight concurrent loops or high-frequency counters. It also shows how false sharing may unpredictably affect memory use due to invalidation overhead.</p>

It's free to implement and often leads to better memory efficiency without changing any logic—only field order needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Guidelines for struct alignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order fields from largest to smallest. Starting with larger fields helps the compiler avoid inserting padding to meet alignment requirements. Smaller fields can fill in the gaps naturally.</li>
<li>Group fields of the same size together. This lets the compiler pack them more efficiently and minimizes wasted space.</li>
<li>Insert padding intentionally when needed. In concurrent code, separating fields that are accessed by different goroutines can prevent false sharing—a subtle but costly issue where multiple goroutines compete over the same cache line.</li>
<li>Avoid interleaving small and large fields. Mixing sizes leads to inefficient memory usage due to extra alignment padding between fields.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/fieldalignment">fieldalignment</a> linter to verify. This tool helps catch suboptimal layouts automatically during development.</li>
