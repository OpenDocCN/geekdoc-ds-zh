- en: Following the precomputation steps outlined in the methodology, we used the
    Finite Element Method to assemble the global mass (M) and stiffness (K) matrices.
    After applying fixed boundary conditions to one end of the beam, we solved the
    generalized eigenvalue problem (Kx=λMx) to find the lowest-frequency mode shapes
    (ψi​) and their corresponding frequencies (ωi​=λi​​).

- en: The primary limitation of linear modal analysis is that it produces visible
    artifacts when undergoing large deformations. To demonstrate this, we designed
    a second experiment focused exclusively on the first bending mode.

    **(1) the beam's centerline stretches significantly**, and **(2) its total area
    increases significantly.**.

- en: These artifacts occur because the linear model cannot account for the geometric
    nonlinearities that arise from large rotations. This failure is the primary motivation
    for the methods described in the following section, which are designed specifically
    to overcome these limitations and accurately simulate large, physically plausible
    motions.
