- en: In this lecture, we explore the simulation of deformable solids with the aim
    of developing a discrete, computationally solvable problem. The primary goal is
    to introduce the abstract algebraic concepts inherent in this problem. We approach
    elasticity simulation using a top-down architectural view, placing mathematical
    modeling at the forefront.

- en: The study of classical elastic solids physics largely revolves around Partial
    Differential Equations (PDEs). In continuum mechanics and finite element analysis
    literature, the norm is to first derive the continuous form of these PDEs, elaborating
    on each term's origin, before adapting them to discrete programming languages.
    Often, this adaptation appears in later sections, creating a sense of anticipation
    for the reader.

    PDEs into the discussion as needed, evenly distributing these topics to avoid
    overwhelming the reader. This method links theory to practice incrementally, enhancing
    understanding.

- en: We introduce the main problem formulation early, offering an overview of its
    numerical solutions. This gives readers an initial comprehensive view, sparking
    curiosity and motivating deeper exploration in later chapters. This strategy makes
    the learning process smoother and more intuitive, helping readers effortlessly
    connect complex concepts and quickly grasp the subject's core.
