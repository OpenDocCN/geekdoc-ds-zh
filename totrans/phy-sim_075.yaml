- en: At the end of this chapter, we implement the Neo-Hookean model introduced in
    the previous lectures to simulate inversion-free elastic solids. The excutable
    Python project for this section can be found at [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial)
    under the `6_inv_free` folder. [MUDA](https://github.com/MuGdxy/muda) GPU implementations
    can be found at [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu)
    under the `simulators/6_inv_free` folder. Instead of discretizing elasticity onto
    the springs as in the mass-spring model, we discretize the Neo-Hookean model onto
    triangle elements, apply chain rules to compute elastic forces according to the
    relation between deformation gradient F and world-space nodal position x, and
    then develop a root-finding based approach to filter the initial step size of
    line search for guaranteed non-inversion.
