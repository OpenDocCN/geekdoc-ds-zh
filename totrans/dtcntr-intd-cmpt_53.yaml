    we can get from one place to another, but also in what it “costs” (where we may
    have many different cost measures: money, distance, time, units of carbon dioxide,
    etc.). On the Internet, we might care about the [☛ latency](glossary.html#%28elem._glossary-latency%29)
    or [☛ bandwidth](glossary.html#%28elem._glossary-bandwidth%29) over a link. Even
    in a social network, we might like to describe the degree of closeness of a friend.
    In short, in many graphs we are interested not only in the direction of an edge
    but also in some abstract numeric measure, which we call its weight.'

    This does not invalidate what we’ve studied so far: if a node is reachable in
    an unweighted graph, it remains reachable in a weighted one. But the operations
    we are going to study below only make sense in a weighted graph.We can, however,
    always treat an unweighted graph as a weighted one by giving every edge the same,
    constant, positive weight (say one).'

    edge be given a positive weight?

- en: Weights are not the only kind of data we might record about edges. For instance,
    if the nodes in a graph represent people, the edges might be labeled with their
    relationship (“mother”, “friend”, etc.). What other kinds of data can you imagine
    recording for edges?
