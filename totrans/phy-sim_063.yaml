- en: We have X and x as material coordinates and world coordinates, respectively,
    each associated with domains Ω0​ and Ωt​. For any point X within Ω0​, the mapping
    function ϕ transports it to Ωt​ at a specific time t, represented as x=ϕ(X,t).

- en: '****Definition 12.2.1 (Deformation Gradient).**** The Jacobian of the deformation
    map ϕ is referred to as the deformation gradient and is crucial in describing
    the physics of elasticity. It is commonly denoted as F and defined by the relation:
    F(X,t)=∂X∂ϕ​(X,t)=∂X∂x​(X,t). Discretely, this Jacobian often takes the form of
    a small 2×2 or 3×3 matrix. For materials like cloth or thin shells in 3D, F might
    be a 3×2 matrix, reflecting the 2D nature of the material space. Thus, F(⋅,t):Ω0→Rd×d
    maps every material point X to a Rd×d matrix that describes the deformation Jacobian
    at time t. Using index notation, it can be expressed as: Fij​=∂Xj​∂ϕi​​=∂Xj​∂xi​​,i,j=1,…,d.'

    Equation [(12.1.1)](lec12.1-continuum_motion.html#eq:lec12:motion_eg1), where
    the result is the identity matrix. Similarly, for the deformation map in Equation
    [(12.1.2)](lec12.1-continuum_motion.html#eq:lec12:motion_eg2), the deformation
    gradient F equals R. In both cases, the object does not undergo real deformation;
    these are merely examples of rigid transformations. Such deformation gradients
    should not lead to any internal forces within the material unless artistic effects
    are intentionally being pursued (such as in a cartoon).

- en: '****Example 12.2.1.**** Intuitively, the deformation gradient F indicates the
    extent of local deformation within a material. Consider two nearby points, x10​
    and x20​, embedded in the material at the start of the simulation (as illustrated
    in [Figure 12.2.1](#fig:lec12:deformation_map)). If x1​ and x2​ represent these
    points in the current configuration, the relationship between these points can
    be expressed as: (x2​−x1​)=F(x20​−x10​). This equation shows how the deformation
    gradient transforms the initial distance between the points into their current
    separation, thus quantifying the local deformation.'

- en: The determinant of the deformation gradient F, commonly denoted by J, is crucial
    because it characterizes the infinitesimal volume change during deformation. This
    is expressed as J=det(F). The value of J represents the ratio of the infinitesimal
    volume of the material in the deformed configuration Ωt to its original volume
    in Ω0. For instance, in rigid motions, which include rotations and translations,
    F is a rotation matrix and therefore J=1. Notably, the identity matrix, being
    a rotation matrix, also results in J=1.

- en: If J>1, it indicates a volume increase, whereas J<1 indicates a decrease. A
    situation where J=0 suggests that the volume has effectively become zero, a scenario
    that is impossible in the real world but can occur numerically. In 3D, this indicates
    that the material is compressed to such an extent that it might collapse into
    a plane, line, or even a point without volume. Conversely, J<0 indicates material
    inversion. For example, in 2D, if J<0 for a triangle, it implies that one vertex
    has passed through the opposing edge, effectively 'inverting' the triangle and
    making its area negative. As seen in the [Moving Boundary Conditions](lec11-mov_DBC.html)
    section, severe compression of an elastic square can lead to inversions. In such
    cases, J serves as a direct measure of this artifact and is utilized in many elasticity
    models to ensure simulations are free from inversions.
