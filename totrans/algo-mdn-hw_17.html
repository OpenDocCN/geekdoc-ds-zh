When they do not, it is usually because the programmer knows more about the problem than what can be inferred from the source code but failed to communicate this extra information to the compiler.</p><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the intricacies of getting the compiler to do exactly what we want and gathering useful information that can guide further optimizations.</p></article><div class="nextprev"><div class="left"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/throughput/" id="prev-article">← Throughput Computing</a><br/><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/pipelining/">← ../Instruction-Level Parallelism</a></div><div class="right"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/compilation/stages/" id="next-article">Stages of Compilation →</a><br/><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/profiling/">../Profiling →</a></div></div>
