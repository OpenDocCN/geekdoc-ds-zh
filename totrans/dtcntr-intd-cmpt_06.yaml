    process, so that you catch errors you might have made. If your function body is

    `100` pens that say `"Go Bears!"`. The core computation is the same in both cases,

    that we want to perform once we have concrete values for the parameters.

    Run, Pyret will make an entry in the directory with the name of the function.
    If we later use the function, Pyret will look up the code that goes with that
    name, substitute the concrete values we provided for the parameters, and return
    the result of evaluating the resulting expression. Pyret will NOT produce anything
    in the interactions pane for a function definition (other than a report about
    whether the examples hold).

    creating them. We’ll get to those in due course.
