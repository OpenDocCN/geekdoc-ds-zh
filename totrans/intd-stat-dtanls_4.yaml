- en: In Western democracies, citizens’ satisfaction with the government is critically
    related to the electoral success of governing parties in an upcoming election.
    At the same time, satisfied citizens are more willing to support non-preferred
    policies and are less likely to support anti-system or populist parties.

- en: If we are interested in the degree of satisfaction with the government in Germany,
    for example, we first need to define the population we aim to make statements
    about (e.g., people over 18 years old who live in Germany). Conducting interviews
    with each person that belongs to the population would be pointless. Instead, we
    can rely on the “shortcut” of random sampling, in which we randomly select observational
    units from this population (i.e., randomly selected Germans) and survey them.
    The idea is that the results (e.g., mean approval of the government using a survey
    item) from the random sample are representative of the underlying population -
    that is, a close match between the parameter estimated from the sample (e.g.,
    mean approval) and the (unobserved) parameter of the population.

    from a sample reflects the true population parameter. Thus, the goal is to find
    a suitable measure of precision (or uncertainty, as the other “side of the coin”).
    We do this by matching the estimate from the sample with a test distribution that
    reflects likely or unlikely values in terms of probabilities. How this is done
    will be discussed in this case study.

    a certain criterion (i.e., an “event”) to the total number of observations. A
    classic example is the coin toss and the ratio between heads and the total number
    of tosses. Probabilities are always positive (\(P(A)\ge0\)). The probability of
    all possible events (e.g., heads and tails in the case of a coin toss) is 1 (\(P(\Omega)=1\)).
    If events A and B cannot occur simultaneously, then the probability of A or B
    occurring is the summed probability for both events (\(P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)\)).

    (yet). Statistical inference means that we take information from a (random) sample
    and infer from it (not yet known) properties of the population (from which the
    sample was drawn). Basically, only random samples are suitable for this purpose,
    since they represent the underlying population in all properties in the best possible
    way (plus minus some random variation).
  prefs: []

- en: While random samples are the best way to conduct statistical inference, the
    process is not flawless. There is still a chance that the units in our sample
    do not perfectly match all properties of the population due to random deviations.
    It may be that a sample was drawn in which disproportionately many women accidentally
    “slipped in”. These random deviations are called **sampling variability**. The
    following sections should illustrate that sampling variability decreases with
    the number of observations in a sample (“more data is better”) and that if we
    did the process of random sampling over and over again (with a sufficiently large
    number of observations), we would obtain a distribution of sampled estimates that
    are shaped like a normal distribution. This will be tremendously useful when we
    conduct statistical tests, in which we use the normal distribution as if it was
    the sampling distribution of a quantity of interest we can match and test our
    estimate with.

    may be familiar with this from the coin toss experiment. A coin is often tossed
    in succession. After 10 tosses, it is quite possible that heads were tossed 7
    times and tails only 3 times. Nevertheless, the underlying probability is always
    0.5/0.5 (or 50%/50%) and in the population of all coin tosses, heads and tails
    should occur equally often. If we now toss the coin even more often, after 30,
    300, 3000, etc. the observed coin tosses will increasingly match the 0.5/0.5 probability
    distribution.

    of each sample as a histogram will lead to a distribution that (with added samples

    satisfaction with the government of all over-18-year-olds living in Germany).

    of cases (\(n\)) of each of the individual samples, the better the distribution
    of sample estimates corresponds to a normal distribution. This works very well
    with \(n>30\). Moreover, it is not important how the distribution of the characteristic
    to be examined is in the population (e.g., right- or left-skewed). In any case,
    with increasing samples (and \(n>30\)), the distribution of sample estimates will

    What can be said is that the likelihood of this is high. For example, with the

    parameter and it is likely that our one sample is one of the 95 and not one of

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hypothesis testing allows us to test how likely it is that a sample estimate
    corresponds to another value, more specifically the sampling distribution of another
    value. We typically use for this purpose the distribution that is obtained under
    the null hypothesis- that is, for example, the assumption that the difference
    in means between two groups or the correlation between two variables is zero in
    the population. The distribution of a test statistic under the assumption that
    the null hypothesis is true is sometimes labeled “null distribution.” We know
    from the central limit theorem that such a sampling distribution would be normal
    given repeated sampling and a high enough sample size (>30), which implies that
    we can use a normal distribution for our statistical tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal usually is to test the sample estimate we obtained against the null
    distribution. If the estimate is so “extreme” that it becomes very unlikely to
    obtain such a result although the null hypothesis is true, then this would provide
    evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of our alternative hypothesis
    (e.g., the correlation between two variables is positive in the population). Hence,
    the procedure of Null Hypothesis Testing is a form of *proof by contradiction*.
    We assume the opposite of what we want to show and then collect as much evidence
    as possible against that assumption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To begin with, we first formulate the so-called **null hypothesis \(H_0\)**
    (e.g., there is *no* or zero correlation in the population). Next, we formulate
    an **alternative hypothesis \(H_A\)** (e.g., the correlation in the population
    is positive or negative) and then want to show that the correlation we found is
    strong enough so that it becomes very unlikely that \(H_0\) is true. This means
    that we are trying to disprove \(H_0\), which in turn is evidence for \(H_A\).
    Note that we do not assign probabilities for \(H_A\) to be true but probabilities
    to observe a given estimate given that \(H_0\) is true (i.e., \(P\)(correlation
    | \(H_0\)).

- en: The procedures discussed here relate to the concept of hypothesis testing and
    statistical significance. They are essentially concerned with quantifying uncertainty
    and inferring from that whether or not one can assume that a result from a random
    sample can be generalized to the population the sample has been drawn from. Although
    these are important concepts, statistical significance is different from scientific
    or substantive significance, which refers to the degree to which a result is relevant
    against the background of other research findings or alternative explanatory factors.
    Thus, a statistically significant result may not be substantial or, conversely,
    a substantial result may not be statistically significant. Statistical significance,
    for example, is highly dependent on the number of observations that are incorporated
    in calculating the standard error. A measure of the substance of, for example,
    a regression coefficient can be obtained by using standardized effect sizes such
    as beta or Cohen’s D.
