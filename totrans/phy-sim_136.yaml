- en: The quality of the reduced model is determined by the choice of the time-invariant
    basis matrix U∈R3n×r, which we assumed existance of in the previous chapters.
    This basis, which is pre-processed to be mass-orthonormal (UTMU=I), must effectively
    span the space of expected nonlinear deformations.

- en: First, an offline, unreduced simulation is run to generate a set of N deformation
    state vectors {u1​,u2​,...,uN​}. Afterwards, the snapshots are assembled into
    a matrix A=[u1​,u2​,...,uN​]. A basis is extracted by performing a Singular Value
    Decomposition (SVD), typically with respect to the mass-weighted inner product
    ⟨x,y⟩M​=xTMy (a technique known as mass-PCA). The columns of U from the decomposition
    A=UΣVT that correspond to the largest r singular values form the basis U!

    of a slow, offline pre-simulation.

    nonlinear response, without requiring a non-reduced pre-simulation like POD.

- en: The key insight is that linear modes are an incomplete basis. When a nonlinear
    system is excited in the direction of a linear mode, other deformations **naturally
    co-appear** due to nonlinear coupling. Modal derivatives are precisely these coupled
    deformations.

    applied along the linear modes Ulin​: fint​(u)=MUlin​Λp, where Λ is the diagonal

- en: This expansion reveals the system's response structure. The first-order derivatives,
    ψi​=∂pi​∂u​∣p=0​, are precisely the familiar linear vibration modes, representing
    the initial linear response to the applied force. The crucial nonlinear couplings
    are captured by the second-order derivatives, Φij​=∂pi​∂pj​∂2u​∣p=0​, which are
    known as the **modal derivatives**. Each Φij​ is a deformation vector that can
    be computed by solving a linear system involving the constant, rest-state stiffness
    matrix K.

- en: The full set of vectors {ψi​,Φij​} is typically too large. A compact, r-dimensional
    basis U is formed by collecting all linear modes and modal derivatives, scaling
    them to prioritize low-frequency contributions, and then using mass-PCA to extract
    the most significant combined shapes. This produces a general-purpose basis that
    captures essential nonlinear behavior without any prior knowledge of runtime forces.
