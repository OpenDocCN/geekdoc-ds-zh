<h1>17.3 Graphs With Weighted Edges🔗</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/weighted-graphs.html">https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/weighted-graphs.html</a></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td/></tr></table><p>Consider a transportation graph: we are usually interested not only in
whether we can get from one place to another, but also in what it
“costs” (where we may have many different cost measures: money,
distance, time, units of carbon dioxide, etc.). On the Internet, we
might care about the <a href="glossary.html#%28elem._glossary-latency%29" data-pltdoc="x">☛ latency</a> or
<a href="glossary.html#%28elem._glossary-bandwidth%29" data-pltdoc="x">☛ bandwidth</a> over a link. Even in a social network, we
might like to describe the degree of closeness of a friend. In short,
in many graphs we are interested not only in the direction of an edge
but also in some abstract numeric measure, which we call its
weight.</p><p>In the rest of this study, we will assume that our graph edges have
weights. This does not invalidate what we’ve studied so far: if a node
is reachable in an unweighted graph, it remains reachable in a
weighted one. But the operations we are going to study below
only make sense in a weighted graph.We can, however,
always treat an unweighted graph as a weighted one by giving every
edge the same, constant, positive weight (say one).</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>When treating an unweighted graph as a weighted one, why do we care

For
instance, if the nodes in a graph represent people, the edges might be
labeled with their relationship (“mother”, “friend”, etc.). What
other kinds of data can you imagine recording for edges?</p></blockquote></blockquote>
