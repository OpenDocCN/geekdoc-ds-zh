  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Counting began not in books, but in life. Early humans needed to remember -
    how many sheep wandered, how many jars were full, how many days had passed. To
    keep track, they used pebbles, sticks, or scratches, each one standing for something
    real. This simple act - letting one thing stand for another - gave birth to number.
    It was a way of extending memory into matter. From gesture came mark, from mark
    came meaning.

    lost; memory could fade. Writing number made memory permanent. Across Sumer and
    Egypt, clay tablets and tallies turned fleeting thoughts into fixed signs. Over
    time, simple marks became symbols, each carrying an idea beyond its shape. Numbers
    were no longer just quantities - they became part of language.

    subtracting, multiplying, dividing - turned counting into calculation. Farmers
    planned harvests, builders measured stone, merchants balanced trade. Step by step,
    arithmetic taught that numbers could not only describe the world but also *predict*
    it. The rules discovered in practice became the grammar of quantity.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    models learn by predicting words, absorbing patterns of grammar, meaning, and
    context. From simple n-grams to transformers with billions of parameters, they
    capture not only syntax but subtlety. In their vast text, machines found a mirror
    of thought - and a medium for reasoning through words.
