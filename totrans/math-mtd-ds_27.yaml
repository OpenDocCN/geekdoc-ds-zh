- en: A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a substitution of a single nucleotide
    that occurs at a specific position in the genome, where each variation is present
    at a level of more than 1% in the population. For example, at a specific base
    position in the human genome, the C nucleotide may appear in most individuals,
    but in a minority of individuals, the position is occupied by an A. This means
    that there is a SNP at this specific position, and the two possible nucleotide
    variations – C or A – are said to be the alleles for this specific position.

- en: the population structure of seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses using hemagglutinin
    (HA) sequences. Changes in the HA gene are largely responsible for immune escape
    of the virus (antigenic shift), and allow seasonal influenza to persist by mounting
    yearly epidemics peaking in winter. These genetic changes also force influenza
    vaccines to be updated on a yearly basis. […] Assessing the genetic evolution
    of a pathogen through successive epidemics is of considerable epidemiological
    interest. In the case of seasonal influenza, we would like to ascertain how genetic
    changes accumulate among strains from one winter epidemic to the next.

    between 2001 and 2007 available from Genbank. Only sequences for which a location
    (country) and a date (year and month) were available were retained, which allowed
    us to classify strains into yearly winter epidemics.
