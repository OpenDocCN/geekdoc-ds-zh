  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This short book is a complete introduction to statistics and data analysis using
    R and RStudio. It contains hands-on exercises with real data—mostly from social
    sciences. In addition, this book presents four key ingredients of statistical
    data analysis (univariate statistics, bivariate statistics, statistical inference,
    and regression analysis) as brief case studies. The motivation for this was to
    provide students with practical cases that help them navigate new concepts and
    serve as an anchor for recalling the acquired knowledge in exams or while conducting
    their own data analysis.

- en: The case study logic is expected to increase motivation for engaging with the
    materials. As we all know, academic teaching is not the same as before the pandemic.
    Students are (rightfully) increasingly reluctant to chalk-and-talk techniques
    of teaching, and we have all developed dopamine-related addictions to social media
    content which have considerably shortened our ability to concentrate. This poses
    challenges to academic teaching in general and complex content such as statistics
    and data science in particular.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book consists of four case studies that provide a short, yet comprehensive,
    introduction to statistics and data analysis. The examples used in the book are
    based on real data from official statistics and publicly available surveys. While
    each case study follows its own logic, I advise reading them consecutively. The
    goal is to provide readers with an opportunity to learn independently and to gather
    a solid foundation of hands-on knowledge of statistics and data analysis. Each
    case study contains questions that can be answered in the boxes below. The solutions
    to the questions can be viewed below the boxes (by clicking on the arrow next
    to the word “solution”). It is advised to save answers to a separate document
    because this content is not saved and cannot be accessed after reloading the book
    page.

    You can read this book online for free. Copies in printable format may be ordered

    examples and analyses provided in this book as illustrations in lectures (and
    by acknowledging the source). This book can be used for self-study by everyone
    who wants to acquire foundational knowledge in basic statistics and practical
    skills in data analysis. The materials can also be used as a refresher on statistical
    foundations.

    and to download the materials from [HERE](https://conradziller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/introstatsfiles_v3.zip).
    The scripts from this material can then be executed while reading the book. This
    helps to get familiar with statistical analysis, and it is just an awesome feeling
    to get your own script running! (On the downside, it is completely normal and
    part of the process that code for statistical analysis does not work. This is
    what helpboards across the web and, more recently, ChatGPT are for. Just google
    your problem and keep on trying, it is, as always, 20% inspiration and 80% consistency.)

    Vierus, and Felix Diehl for helpful feedback on previous versions of this book.
    I want to thank Achim Goerres for his feedback early on and for granting me maximal
    freedom in revising and updating the materials of his introductory lectures on
    Methods and Statistics, which led to the writing of this book. Earlier versions
    of this book have been used in teaching courses on statistics in the Political
    Science undergraduate program at the University of Duisburg-Essen.

- en: The final part of the book is about linear regression analysis, which is the
    natural endpoint for a course on introductory statistics. However, the “ordinary”
    regression is where many further useful techniques come into play—most of which
    can subsumed under the label “Advanced Regression Models”. You will need them
    when analyzing, for example, panel data where the same respondents were interviewed
    multiple times or spatially clustered data from cross-national surveys.
