    due to memory or computational constraints. In such cases, iterative methods provide
    an alternative by generating a sequence of approximate solutions that (ideally)
    converge to the true solution. This section introduces two of the most fundamental
    iterative methods: Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.'

    Ax=b. At each iteration, every component of x is updated independently using only
    the values from the previous iteration. Let A=D+(L+U), where D is the diagonal
    part of A, L is the strictly lower triangular part, and U is the strictly upper
    triangular part. The update rule is: x(k+1)=D−1(b−(L+U)x(k)),(34.2.1) or, component-wise:

    values as soon as they are available. This means each new xi(k+1)​ is immediately
    used in subsequent updates within the same iteration. The update rule is: x(k+1)=(D+L)−1(b−Ux(k)),(34.2.2)

    A **backward Gauss-Seidel** iteration can also be defined, where the updates sweep
    from i=n down to 1 in each iteration: x(k+1)=(D+U)−1(b−Lx(k)),(34.2.3) or, component-wise:

    absolute value of the eigenvalues of G). The method converges if and only if ρ(G)<1.'

- en: A sufficient condition for convergence of both methods is that A is **strictly
    diagonally dominant** (i.e., ∣Aii​∣>∑j=i​∣Aij​∣ for all i). For the Gauss-Seidel
    method, convergence is also guaranteed if A is symmetric positive definite (SPD).
