    to optimization time integrators, and presented them as straightforward linear
    equality constraints. There are two types of DBCs: **sticky** and **slip**. Sticky
    DBCs immobilize certain nodes, fixing their positions, whereas slip DBCs restrict
    the movement of nodes to within a plane or a line.'

- en: We focused on cases where sticky DBCs are already met at the start of a time
    step. In such scenarios, the **DOF elimination method** proves efficient. This
    technique modifies the gradient and Hessian of the Incremental Potential, ensuring
    that the resulting search direction remains within the feasible space.

    methods for their efficient incorporation into optimization problems.
