- en: Although they might be satisfied at the start of a time step, general slip Dirichlet
    boundary conditions (DBC) present unique challenges. Unlike the sticky DBCs, they
    cannot be directly addressed using the [DOF elimination method](lec5.2-DOF_elimin.html),
    primarily because their constraint Jacobian does not consist of identity matrix
    blocks. To navigate this complexity, we can adopt a change-of-basis strategy.

    a particular type of slip DBC: those that are axis-aligned. Understanding this
    specific case will lay the groundwork for tackling the broader range of slip DBCs.'
