    Centrality is a vague concept. It can be defined in many different ways depending
    on the context and the type of network. Quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality):'

- en: In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality assign numbers
    or rankings to nodes within a graph corresponding to their network position. Applications
    include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure
    nodes in the Internet or urban networks, super-spreaders of disease, and brain
    networks. […] Centrality indices are answers to the question “What characterizes
    an important vertex?” The answer is given in terms of a real-valued function on
    the vertices of a graph, where the values produced are expected to provide a ranking
    which identifies the most important nodes. The word “importance” has a wide number
    of meanings, leading to many different definitions of centrality.

- en: In an undirected graph, a natural approach is to look at the degree of a vertex
    as a measure of its importance (also referred to as degree centrality). But it
    is hardly the only one. One could for instance look at the average distance to
    all other nodes (its reciprocal is the [closeness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality))
    or at the number of shortest paths between pairs of vertices going through the
    vertex (known as [betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality)).

    instance, there is now the in-degree as well as the out-degree.

    Web (from now on, the Web). In this case, the vertices are webpages and a directed
    edge from \(u\) to \(v\) indicates a hyperlink from page \(u\) to page \(v\).
    The Web is much too large to analyze here. Instead, we will consider a tiny (but
    still interesting!) subset of it, the pages of [Wolfram’s MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com),
    a wonderful mathematics resource.

    network](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Scale-FreeNetwork.html). A definition and
    notable properties are described. Importantly for us, in a section entitled “SEE
    ALSO”, other related mathematical concepts are listed with a link to their MathWorld
    page. In the case of scale-free networks, the [small world network](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmallWorldNetwork.html)
    topic is referenced, among others.

    datasets and can be downloaded [here](https://netset.telecom-paris.fr/pages/mathworld.html).
    We load it now. For convenience, we have reformatted it into the files `mathworld-adjacency.csv`
    and `mathworld-titles.csv`, which are available on the [GitHub of the book](https://github.com/MMiDS-textbook/MMiDS-textbook.github.io/tree/main/utils/datasets).
