    with obstacles or themselves. This topic was briefly touched upon in a previous
    [section](lec2.3-contact.html). In this lecture, we delve deeper into the specifics
    of non-interpenetration within the framework of the Incremental Potential Contact
    (IPC) method. Our focus will be on a simplified yet significant scenario: contact
    between solids and obstacles that have closed boundaries. This specific focus
    allows us to thoroughly explore the mechanics and principles of the IPC method
    in a controlled setting.'
