- en: If you are reading this book, I probably don’t have to sell you on CUDA. Readers
    of this book should already be familiar with CUDA from using NVIDIA’s SDK materials
    and documentation, taking a course on parallel programming, or reading the excellent
    introductory book *CUDA by Example* (Addison-Wesley, 2011) by Jason Sanders and
    Edward Kandrot.

- en: 'Reviewing *CUDA by Example*, I am still struck by how much ground the book
    covers. Assuming no special knowledge from the audience, the authors manage to
    describe everything from memory types and their applications to graphics interoperability
    and even atomic operations. It is an excellent introduction to CUDA, but it is
    just that: an introduction. When it came to giving more detailed descriptions
    of the workings of the platform, the GPU hardware, the compiler driver `nvcc`,
    and important “building block” parallel algorithms like parallel prefix sum (“scan”),
    Jason and Edward rightly left those tasks to others.'

- en: This book is intended to help novice to intermediate CUDA programmers continue
    to elevate their game, building on the foundation laid by earlier work. In addition,
    while introductory texts are best read from beginning to end, *The CUDA Handbook*
    can be sampled. If you’re preparing to build or program a new CUDA-capable platform,
    a review of [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02) (“[Hardware Architecture](ch02.html#ch02)”)
    might be in order. If you are wondering whether your application would benefit
    from using CUDA streams for additional concurrency, take a look at [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06)
    (“[Streams and Events](ch06.html#ch06)”). Other chapters give detailed descriptions
    of the software architecture, GPU subsystems such as texturing and the streaming
    multiprocessors, and applications chosen according to their data access pattern
    and their relative importance in the universe of parallel algorithms. The chapters
    are relatively self-contained, though they do reference one another when appropriate.

- en: The latest innovations, up to and including CUDA 5.0, also are covered here.
    In the last few years, CUDA and its target platforms have significantly evolved.
    When *CUDA by Example* was published, the GeForce GTX 280 (GT200) was new, but
    since then, two generations of CUDA-capable hardware have become available. So
    besides more detailed discussions of existing features such as mapped pinned memory,
    this book also covers new instructions like Fermi’s “ballot” and Kepler’s “shuffle”
    and features such as 64-bit and unified virtual addressing and dynamic parallelism.
    We also discuss recent platform innovations, such as the integration of the PCI
    Express bus controller into Intel’s “Sandy Bridge” CPUs.

    keep it by your keyboard and consult it periodically—it’s my sincerest hope that
    you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
