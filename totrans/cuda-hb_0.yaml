- en: If you are reading this book, I probably don’t have to sell you on CUDA. Readers
    of this book should already be familiar with CUDA from using NVIDIA’s SDK materials
    and documentation, taking a course on parallel programming, or reading the excellent
    introductory book *CUDA by Example* (Addison-Wesley, 2011) by Jason Sanders and
    Edward Kandrot.

  zh: 如果你正在阅读本书，我大概不需要向你推销CUDA了。本书的读者应该已经通过使用NVIDIA的SDK资料和文档、参加并行编程课程，或者阅读Jason Sanders和Edward
    Kandrot的优秀入门书籍*《CUDA by Example》*（Addison-Wesley，2011）对CUDA有所了解。
- en: 'Reviewing *CUDA by Example*, I am still struck by how much ground the book
    covers. Assuming no special knowledge from the audience, the authors manage to
    describe everything from memory types and their applications to graphics interoperability
    and even atomic operations. It is an excellent introduction to CUDA, but it is
    just that: an introduction. When it came to giving more detailed descriptions
    of the workings of the platform, the GPU hardware, the compiler driver `nvcc`,
    and important “building block” parallel algorithms like parallel prefix sum (“scan”),
    Jason and Edward rightly left those tasks to others.'

  zh: 回顾*《CUDA by Example》*，我仍然为这本书覆盖的内容广度所震撼。在没有假设听众具备特殊知识的情况下，作者成功地从内存类型及其应用，到图形互操作性，甚至原子操作，全面地描述了所有内容。这是一本出色的CUDA入门书籍，但它仅仅是入门。在对平台的工作原理、GPU硬件、编译器驱动`nvcc`以及重要的“构建块”并行算法（如并行前缀和（“扫描”））进行更详细描述时，Jason和Edward明智地将这些任务交给了其他人。
- en: This book is intended to help novice to intermediate CUDA programmers continue
    to elevate their game, building on the foundation laid by earlier work. In addition,
    while introductory texts are best read from beginning to end, *The CUDA Handbook*
    can be sampled. If you’re preparing to build or program a new CUDA-capable platform,
    a review of [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02) (“[Hardware Architecture](ch02.html#ch02)”)
    might be in order. If you are wondering whether your application would benefit
    from using CUDA streams for additional concurrency, take a look at [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06)
    (“[Streams and Events](ch06.html#ch06)”). Other chapters give detailed descriptions
    of the software architecture, GPU subsystems such as texturing and the streaming
    multiprocessors, and applications chosen according to their data access pattern
    and their relative importance in the universe of parallel algorithms. The chapters
    are relatively self-contained, though they do reference one another when appropriate.

  zh: 本书旨在帮助初学者到中级CUDA程序员继续提升他们的技能，在之前工作的基础上进一步发展。此外，虽然入门书籍最好从头到尾阅读，*《CUDA手册》*可以根据需要选择阅读。如果你正在准备构建或编程一个新的CUDA平台，建议先阅读[第2章](ch02.html#ch02)（“[硬件架构](ch02.html#ch02)”）。如果你在考虑你的应用是否能通过使用CUDA流来实现更多并发性，不妨查看[第6章](ch06.html#ch06)（“[流和事件](ch06.html#ch06)”）。其他章节详细描述了软件架构、GPU子系统，如纹理处理和流处理多核，以及根据数据访问模式和它们在并行算法宇宙中的相对重要性选取的应用。这些章节相对独立，尽管在适当的情况下会相互引用。
- en: The latest innovations, up to and including CUDA 5.0, also are covered here.
    In the last few years, CUDA and its target platforms have significantly evolved.
    When *CUDA by Example* was published, the GeForce GTX 280 (GT200) was new, but
    since then, two generations of CUDA-capable hardware have become available. So
    besides more detailed discussions of existing features such as mapped pinned memory,
    this book also covers new instructions like Fermi’s “ballot” and Kepler’s “shuffle”
    and features such as 64-bit and unified virtual addressing and dynamic parallelism.
    We also discuss recent platform innovations, such as the integration of the PCI
    Express bus controller into Intel’s “Sandy Bridge” CPUs.

  zh: 本书还涵盖了最新的创新，包括 CUDA 5.0。在过去的几年里，CUDA 及其目标平台有了显著的发展。当*《CUDA实例》*首次出版时，GeForce
    GTX 280（GT200）还是新发布的显卡，但此后已经推出了两代支持CUDA的硬件。因此，除了对现有特性（如映射固定内存）的更详细讨论外，本书还涉及了新指令，如Fermi架构的“ballot”和Kepler架构的“shuffle”，以及64位和统一虚拟寻址、动态并行性等新特性。我们还讨论了最近的硬件平台创新，例如Intel“Sandy
    Bridge”CPU中集成的PCI Express总线控制器。
- en: However you choose to read the book—whether you read it straight through or
    keep it by your keyboard and consult it periodically—it’s my sincerest hope that
    you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
