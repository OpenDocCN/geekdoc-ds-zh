<p>In physics-based simulation, the <strong>continuum assumption</strong> enables us to model a wide range of materials with rich and diverse behaviors. While <strong>hyperelasticity</strong> provides a convenient and elegant model for materials that return to their rest shape after deformation, such as rubber or soft tissue, it represents only a small portion of the physical phenomena observed in the real world.</p>
<p>Many natural and everyday materials, including <strong>sand</strong>, <strong>snow</strong>, <strong>mud</strong>, <strong>metal</strong>, <strong>foam</strong>, and <strong>fracturing solids</strong>, exhibit irreversible deformation, dissipation, or flow-like behavior that cannot be captured by purely elastic models. These materials require constitutive models that incorporate <strong>plasticity</strong> (permanent deformation) and <strong>viscosity</strong> (rate-dependent stress response).</p>
<p>The core difference between <strong>elasticity</strong> and <strong>plasticity</strong> lies in how materials store and dissipate energy. Elastic deformation is reversible and energy-conservative; plastic deformation is <strong>irreversible</strong>, governed by <strong>yield criteria</strong>, and involves <strong>energy dissipation</strong> through internal reconfiguration of the material structure.</p>
<p>MPM is particularly well suited for simulating plastic and viscous materials, as it naturally supports large deformations, history-dependent state updates, and localized inelastic flow, without suffering from mesh entanglement, element inversion, or remeshing-related artifacts common in traditional mesh-based methods.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this lecture, we will introduce how plasticity and viscosity are incorporated into MPM simulations. We begin with the <a href="./lec27.1-disc_plastic_flow.html">discretization of plastic flow</a> and the representation of irreversible deformation. We then describe how to enforce material-specific yield conditions and perform <a href="./lec27.2-yield_criterion.html">return mapping</a> to constrain deformation within admissible limits.</p>
