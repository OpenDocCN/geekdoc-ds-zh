- en: 'Recent activities of major chip manufacturers such as NVIDIA make it more evident
    than ever that future designs of microprocessors and large HPC systems will be
    hybrid/heterogeneous in nature. These heterogeneous systems will rely on the integration
    of two major types of components in varying proportions:'

  zh: 如NVIDIA等主要芯片制造商的近期活动所示，未来微处理器和大型高性能计算系统的设计将更加明显地呈现混合/异构特性。这些异构系统将依赖于两种主要组件的集成，并根据不同的比例进行组合：
- en: '• **Multi- and many-core CPU technology**: The number of cores will continue
    to escalate because of the desire to pack more and more components on a chip while
    avoiding the power wall, the instruction-level parallelism wall, and the memory
    wall.'

  zh: • **多核和多核CPU技术**：由于希望在芯片上集成越来越多的组件，同时避免功率瓶颈、指令级并行壁垒和内存瓶颈，核心数量将继续增加。
- en: '• **Special-purpose hardware and massively parallel accelerators**: For example,
    GPUs from NVIDIA have outpaced standard CPUs in floating-point performance in
    recent years. Furthermore, they have arguably become as easy, if not easier, to
    program than multicore CPUs.'

  zh: • **专用硬件和大规模并行加速器**：例如，NVIDIA的GPU在近年来的浮点性能上超越了标准CPU。此外，它们的编程方式几乎与多核CPU一样简单，甚至更容易。
- en: The relative balance between these component types in future designs is not
    clear and will likely vary over time. There seems to be no doubt that future generations
    of computer systems, ranging from laptops to supercomputers, will consist of a
    composition of heterogeneous components. Indeed, the *petaflop* (10^(15) floating-point
    operations per second) performance barrier was breached by such a system.

  zh: 这些组件类型在未来设计中的相对平衡尚不明确，并可能随时间变化。似乎毫无疑问，未来一代计算机系统，从笔记本电脑到超级计算机，都将由异构组件组成。事实上，*千万亿次*（每秒10^(15)次浮点运算）性能壁垒正是通过这种系统突破的。
- en: And yet the problems and the challenges for developers in the new computational
    landscape of hybrid processors remain daunting. Critical parts of the software
    infrastructure are already having a very difficult time keeping up with the pace
    of change. In some cases, performance cannot scale with the number of cores because
    an increasingly large portion of time is spent on data movement rather than arithmetic.
    In other cases, software tuned for performance is delivered years after the hardware
    arrives and so is obsolete on delivery. And in some cases, as on some recent GPUs,
    software will not run at all because programming environments have changed too
    much.

  zh: 然而，开发者在新的混合处理器计算环境中面临的问题和挑战依然严峻。软件基础设施的关键部分已经在很大程度上无法跟上变化的步伐。在某些情况下，性能无法随着核心数量的增加而扩展，因为越来越多的时间被花费在数据传输上，而不是算术运算上。在其他情况下，为了性能而调优的软件在硬件到达几年后才被交付，结果在交付时已经过时。而在某些情况下，比如最近的某些GPU，软件根本无法运行，因为编程环境已经发生了太大的变化。
