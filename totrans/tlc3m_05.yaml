  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the chill of a seventeenth-century dawn, René Descartes gazed upon a fly
    tracing patterns on the ceiling of his chamber. Each flutter left no mark, yet
    in his mind, Descartes began to imagine a way to describe its motion - to assign
    to every point in space a pair of numbers, to capture rest and change alike. Thus
    was born the Cartesian plane, the invisible lattice that bound geometry to algebra,
    and vision to reason. What the Greeks had seen in figure, Descartes saw in form
    and function - that shape itself could be written, that space could be solved.

    in dust. After him, it became a grammar of equations, where line and curve obeyed
    symbol. To merge coordinate with quantity was to fuse body and mind - the realm
    of sight with that of symbol. Each axis stood as a pillar: one for direction,
    one for extension. Their crossing - the origin - was not merely a point, but a
    principle: the meeting of perception and abstraction, the zero point of understanding.'

    by number. Euclid’s proofs were arguments of sight, not computation. Descartes,
    born of a new age, sought unity - not between gods and mortals, but between lines
    and laws. The eye saw curve; the mind sought pattern. By assigning every point
    a coordinate, Descartes revealed that position itself could be written - that
    space could be counted.

    Each shape became a sentence, each curve a phrase. The circle - once compass-drawn

    parabola - once traced by sun and mirror - took new life as \[ y = ax^2 + bx +
    c \] a story of balance between curvature and constant. To see was now to solve.

    and the tides in their rise. Nature, he saw, was not chaos but coherence, a vast
    system governed by universal law. Every motion, every collision, every curve in
    the sky followed rules not of whim but of reason. In this realization, the cosmos
