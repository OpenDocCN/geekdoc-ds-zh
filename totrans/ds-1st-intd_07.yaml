    to an observation. For example, Figure [3.1](wrangling.html#fig:02-obs) displays
    a data set of city populations. Here, the variables are “region, year, population”;
    each of these are properties that can be collected or measured. The first observation
    is “Toronto, 2016, 2235145”; these are the values that the three variables take
    for the first entity in the data set. There are 13 entities in the data set in

- en: It is important in R to make sure you represent your data with the correct type.
    Many of the `tidyverse` functions we use in this book treat the various data types
    differently. You should use integers and double types (which both fall under the
    “numeric” umbrella type) to represent numbers and perform arithmetic. Doubles
    are more common than integers in R, though; for instance, a double data type is
    the default when you create a vector of numbers using `c()`, and when you read
    in whole numbers via `read_csv`. Characters are used to represent data that should
    be thought of as “text”, such as words, names, paths, URLs, and more. Factors
    help us encode variables that represent *categories*; a factor variable takes
    one of a discrete set of values known as *levels* (one for each category). The
    levels can be ordered or unordered. Even though factors can sometimes *look* like
    characters, they are not used to represent text, words, names, and paths in the
    way that characters are; in fact, R internally stores factors using integers!
    There are other basic data types in R, such as *raw* and *complex*, but we do
    not use these in this textbook.

    integers, logicals, and even other lists). See Figure [3.4](wrangling.html#fig:02-vec-vs-list).

    packages. However, the `tidyverse` functions that we use throughout this book
    all work with a special kind of data frame called a *tibble*. Tibbles have some
    additional features and benefits over built-in data frames in R. These include
    the ability to add useful attributes (such as grouping, which we will discuss
    later) and more predictable type preservation when subsetting. Because a tibble
    is just a data frame with some added features, we will collectively refer to both
    built-in R data frames and tibbles as *data frames* in this book.

    a data frame is a built-in R data frame or a tibble. If the data object is a data
    frame, `class` will return `"data.frame"`. If the data object is a tibble it will
    return `"tbl_df" "tbl" "data.frame"`. You can easily convert built-in R data frames
    to tibbles using the `tidyverse` `as_tibble` function. For example we can check
    the class of the Canadian languages data set, `can_lang`, we worked with in the
    previous chapters and we see it is a tibble.'

- en: There are many good reasons for making sure your data are tidy as a first step
    in your analysis. The most important is that it is a single, consistent format
    that nearly every function in the `tidyverse` recognizes. No matter what the variables
    and observations in your data represent, as long as the data frame is tidy, you
    can manipulate it, plot it, and analyze it using the same tools. If your data
    is *not* tidy, you will have to write special bespoke code in your analysis that
    will not only be error-prone, but hard for others to understand. Beyond making
    your analysis more accessible to others and less error-prone, tidy data is also
    typically easy for humans to interpret. Given these benefits, it is well worth
    spending the time to get your data into a tidy format upfront. Fortunately, there
    are many well-designed `tidyverse` data cleaning/wrangling tools to help you easily
    tidy your data. Let’s explore them below!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Note:** Is there only one shape for tidy data for a given data set? Not necessarily!
    It depends on the statistical question you are asking and what the variables are
    for that question. For tidy data, each variable should be its own column. So,
    just as it’s essential to match your statistical question with the appropriate
    data analysis tool, it’s important to match your statistical question with the
    appropriate variables and ensure they are represented as individual columns to
    make the data tidy.'

- en: One task that is commonly performed to get data into a tidy format is to combine
    values that are stored in separate columns, but are really part of the same variable,
    into one. Data is often stored this way because this format is sometimes more
    intuitive for human readability and understanding, and humans create data sets.
    In Figure [3.7](wrangling.html#fig:02-wide-to-long), the table on the left is
    in an untidy, “wide” format because the year values (2006, 2011, 2016) are stored
    as column names. And as a consequence, the values for population for the various
    cities over these years are also split across several columns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For humans, this table is easy to read, which is why you will often find data
    stored in this wide format. However, this format is difficult to work with when
    performing data visualization or statistical analysis using R. For example, if
    we wanted to find the latest year it would be challenging because the year values
    are stored as column names instead of as values in a single column. So before
    we could apply a function to find the latest year (for example, by using `max`),
    we would have to first extract the column names to get them as a vector and then
    apply a function to extract the latest year. The problem only gets worse if you
    would like to find the value for the population for a given region for the latest
    year. Both of these tasks are greatly simplified once the data is tidied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem with data in this format is that we don’t know what the numbers
    under each year actually represent. Do those numbers represent population size?
    Land area? It’s not clear. To solve both of these problems, we can reshape this
    data set to a tidy data format by creating a column called “year” and a column
    called “population.” This transformation—which makes the data “longer”—is shown
    as the right table in Figure [3.7](wrangling.html#fig:02-wide-to-long).

    package. The `pivot_longer` function combines columns, and is usually used during
    tidying data when we need to make the data frame longer and narrower. To learn
    how to use `pivot_longer`, we will work through an example with the `region_lang_top5_cities_wide.csv`
    data set. This data set contains the counts of how many Canadians cited each language
    as their mother tongue for five major Canadian cities (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver,
    Calgary, and Edmonton) from the 2016 Canadian census. To get started, we will
    load the `tidyverse` package and use `read_csv` to load the (untidy) data.

    [3.8](wrangling.html#fig:img-pivot-longer-with-table) represents the data in the
    “wide” (messy) format. From a data analysis perspective, this format is not ideal
    because the values of the variable *region* (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary,
    and Edmonton) are stored as column names. Thus they are not easily accessible
    to the data analysis functions we will apply to our data set. Additionally, the
    *mother tongue* variable values are spread across multiple columns, which will
    prevent us from doing any desired visualization or statistical tasks until we
    combine them into one column. For instance, suppose we want to know the languages
    with the highest number of Canadians reporting it as their mother tongue among
    all five regions. This question would be tough to answer with the data in its
    current format. We *could* find the answer with the data in this format, though
    it would be much easier to answer if we tidy our data first. If mother tongue
    were instead stored as one column, as shown in the tidy data on the right in Figure
    [3.8](wrangling.html#fig:img-pivot-longer-with-table), we could simply use the
    `max` function in one line of code to get the maximum value.

    a single column—makes it harder to apply many usual `tidyverse` functions. For
    example, finding the maximum number of commuters would require an additional step
    of filtering for the commuter values before the maximum can be computed. In comparison,
    if the data were tidy, all we would have to do is compute the maximum value for
    the commuter column. To reshape this untidy data set to a tidy (and in this case,
    wider) format, we need to create columns called “population”, “commuters”, and
    “incorporated.” This is illustrated in the right table of Figure [3.10](wrangling.html#fig:long-to-wide).

    function generally increases the number of columns (widens) and decreases the
    number of rows in a data set. To learn how to use `pivot_wider`, we will work
    through an example with the `region_lang_top5_cities_long.csv` data set. This
    data set contains the number of Canadians reporting the primary language at home
    and work for five major cities (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton).

    that is not what we want to happen; instead, we would usually like R to ignore
    the missing entries and calculate the summary statistic using all of the other
    non-`NA` values in the column. Fortunately many of these functions provide an
    argument `na.rm` that lets us tell the function what to do when it encounters
    `NA` values. In particular, if we specify `na.rm = TRUE`, the function will ignore
    missing values and return a summary of all the non-missing entries. We show an

    `region_lang` data frame from double type to integer type using the `as.integer`
    function. When we revisit the `region_lang` data frame, we can see that this would
    be the columns from `mother_tongue` to `lang_known`.

    in a similar way for column selection, as we saw when we used `summarize` + `across`
    earlier. As we did above, we again use `across` to specify the columns using `select`
    syntax as well as the function we want to apply on the specified columns. However,
    a key difference here is that we are using `mutate`, which means that we get back
    a data frame with the same number of columns and rows. The only thing that changes
    is the transformation we applied to the specified columns (here `mother_tongue`
    to `lang_known`).

    the `region_lang` data set. In other words, we want to apply the `max` function
    *row-wise.* We will use the (aptly named) `rowwise` function in combination with
    `mutate` to accomplish this task.

- en: Similar to `group_by`, `rowwise` doesn’t appear to do anything when it is called
    by itself. However, we can apply `rowwise` in combination with other functions
    to change how these other functions operate on the data. Notice if we used `mutate`
    without `rowwise`, we would have computed the maximum value across *all* rows
    rather than the maximum value for *each* row. Below we show what would have happened
    had we not used `rowwise`. In particular, the same maximum value is reported in
    every single row; this code does not provide the desired result.

- en: Cleaning and wrangling data can be a very time-consuming process. However, it
    is a critical step in any data analysis. We have explored many different functions
    for cleaning and wrangling data into a tidy format. Table [3.4](wrangling.html#tab:summary-functions-table)
    summarizes some of the key wrangling functions we learned in this chapter. In
    the following chapters, you will learn how you can take this tidy data and do
    so much more with it to answer your burning data science questions!

    and loads a collection of R packages that all follow the tidy data philosophy
    we discussed above. One of the `tidyverse` packages is `dplyr`—a data wrangling
    workhorse. You have already met many of `dplyr`’s functions (`select`, `filter`,
    `mutate`, `arrange`, `summarize`, and `group_by`). To learn more about these functions
    and meet a few more useful functions, we recommend you check out Chapters 5-9
