<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn how to set up the software needed to follow along
with this book on your own computer. Given that installation instructions can
vary based on computer setup, we provide instructions for
multiple operating systems (Ubuntu Linux, MacOS, and Windows).
Although the instructions in this chapter will likely work on many systems,
we have specifically verified that they work on a computer that:</p>
<ul>
<li>runs Windows 10 Home, MacOS 13 Ventura, or Ubuntu 22.04,</li>
<li>uses a 64-bit CPU,</li>
<li>has a connection to the internet,</li>
<li>uses English as the default language.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Chapter learning objectives<a href="setup.html#chapter-learning-objectives-12" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the worksheets that accompany this book.</li>
<li>Install the Docker virtualization engine.</li>
<li>Edit and run the worksheets using JupyterLab running inside a Docker container.</li>
<li>Install Git, JupyterLab Desktop, and R packages.</li>
<li>Edit and run the worksheets using JupyterLab Desktop.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Obtaining the worksheets for this book<a href="setup.html#obtaining-the-worksheets-for-this-book" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>The worksheets containing exercises for this book
are online at <a href="https://worksheets.datasciencebook.ca">https://worksheets.datasciencebook.ca</a>.
The worksheets can be launched directly from that page using the Binder links in the rightmost
column of the table. This is the easiest way to access the worksheets, but note that you will not
be able to save your work and return to it again later.
In order to save your progress, you will need to download the worksheets to your own computer and
work on them locally. You can download the worksheets as a compressed zip file
using <a href="https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/data-science-a-first-intro-worksheets/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">the link at the top of the page</a>.
Once you unzip the downloaded file, you will have a folder containing all of the Jupyter notebook worksheets
accompanying this book. See Chapter <a href="jupyter.html#jupyter">11</a> for
instructions on working with Jupyter notebooks.</p>
</div>
<div id="working-with-docker" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="13.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Working with Docker<a href="setup.html#working-with-docker" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h2>
<p>Once you have downloaded the worksheets, you will next need to install and run
the software required to work on Jupyter notebooks on your own computer. Doing
this setup manually can be quite tricky, as it involves quite a few different
software packages, not to mention getting the right versions of
everything—the worksheets and autograder tests may not work unless all the versions are
exactly right! To keep things simple, we instead recommend that you install
<a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>. Docker lets you run your Jupyter notebooks inside
a pre-built <em>container</em> that comes with precisely the right versions of
all software packages needed run the worksheets that come with this book.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A <em>container</em> is a virtual user space within your computer.
Within the container, you can run software in isolation without interfering with the
other software that already exists on your machine. In this book, we use
a container to run a specific version of the R programming
language, as well as other necessary packages. The container ensures that
the worksheets function correctly, even if you have a different version of R
installed on your computer—or even if you haven’t installed R at all!</p>

<div id="windows" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="13.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.4.1</span> Windows<a href="setup.html#windows" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p><strong>Installation</strong> To install Docker on Windows,
visit <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">the online Docker documentation</a>,
and download the <code>Docker Desktop Installer.exe</code> file. Double-click the file to open the installer
and follow the instructions on the installation wizard, choosing <strong>WSL-2</strong> instead of <strong>Hyper-V</strong> when prompted.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Occasionally, when you first run Docker on Windows, you will encounter an error message. Some common errors you may see:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to update WSL, you can enter <code>cmd.exe</code> in the Start menu to run the command line. Type <code>wsl --update</code> to update WSL.</li>
<li>If the admin account on your computer is different to your user account, you must add the user to the “docker-users” group.
Run Computer Management as an administrator and navigate to <code>Local Users</code> and <code>Groups -&gt; Groups -&gt; docker-users</code>. Right-click to
add the user to the group. Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.</li>
<li>If you need to enable virtualization, you will need to edit your BIOS. Restart your computer, and enter the BIOS using the hotkey
(usually Delete, Esc, and/or one of the F# keys). Look for an “Advanced” menu, and under your CPU settings, set the “Virtualization” option
to “enabled”. Then save the changes and reboot your machine. If you are not familiar with BIOS editing, you may want to find an expert
to help you with this, as editing the BIOS can be dangerous. Detailed instructions for doing this are beyond the scope of this book.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Running JupyterLab</strong> Run Docker Desktop. Once it is running, you need to download and run the
Docker <em>image</em> that we have made available for the worksheets (an <em>image</em> is like a “snapshot” of a
computer with all the right packages pre-installed). You only need to do this step one time; the image will remain
the next time you run Docker Desktop.
In the Docker Desktop search bar, enter <code>ubcdsci/r-dsci-100</code>, as this is
the name of the image. You will see the <code>ubcdsci/r-dsci-100</code> image in the list (Figure <a href="setup.html#fig:docker-desktop-search">13.1</a>),
and “latest” in the Tag drop down menu. We need to change “latest” to the right image version before proceeding.
To find the right tag, open
the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-DSCI/data-science-a-first-intro-worksheets/main/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code> in the worksheets repository</a>,
and look for the line <code>FROM ubcdsci/r-dsci-100:</code> followed by the tag consisting of a sequence of numbers and letters.
Back in Docker Desktop, in the “Tag” drop down menu, click that tag to select the correct image version. Then click
the “Pull” button to download the image.</p>

<p>To start up a <em>container</em> using that image, click the play button beside the
image. This will open the run configuration menu (Figure <a href="setup.html#fig:docker-desktop-runconfig">13.3</a>).
Expand the “Optional settings” drop down menu. In the “Host port” textbox, enter
<code>8888</code>. In the “Volumes” section, click the “Host path” box and navigate to the
folder where your Jupyter worksheets are stored. In the “Container path” text
box, enter <code>/home/jovyan/work</code>. Then click the “Run” button to start the
container.</p>

<p>You can also run the worksheets accompanying this book on your computer
using <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop">JupyterLab Desktop</a>.
The advantage of JupyterLab Desktop over Docker is that it can be easier to install;
Docker can sometimes run into some fairly technical issues (especially on Windows computers)
that require expert troubleshooting. The downside of JupyterLab Desktop is that there is a (very) small chance that
you may not end up with the right versions of all the R packages needed for the worksheets. Docker, on the other hand,
<em>guarantees</em> that the worksheets will work exactly as intended.</p>
<p>In this section, we will cover how to install JupyterLab Desktop,
Git and the JupyterLab Git extension (for version control, as discussed in Chapter <a href="version-control.html#version-control">12</a>), and
all of the R packages needed to run
the code in this book.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.5.1</span> Windows<a href="setup.html#windows-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"/></h3>
<p><strong>Installation</strong> First, we will install Git for version control.
Go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">the Git download page</a> and
download the Windows version of Git. Once the download has finished, run the installer and accept
the default configuration for all pages.
Next, visit the <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#installation">“Installation” section of the JupyterLab Desktop homepage</a>.
Download the <code>JupyterLab-Setup-Windows.exe</code> installer file for Windows.
Double-click the installer to run it, use the default settings.
Run JupyterLab Desktop by clicking the icon on your desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Configuring JupyterLab Desktop</strong>
Next, in the JupyterLab Desktop graphical interface that appears (Figure <a href="setup.html#fig:setup-jlab-gui">13.6</a>),
you will see text at the bottom saying “Python environment not found”. Click “Install using the bundled installer”
to set up the environment.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:setup-jlab-gui"/>

</p>
</div>
Next, we need to add the JupyterLab Git extension (so that
we can use version control directly from within JupyterLab Desktop),
the IRkernel (to enable the R programming language),
and various R software packages. Click “New session…” in the JupyterLab Desktop
user interface, then scroll to the bottom, and click “Terminal” under the “Other” heading (Figure <a href="setup.html#fig:setup-jlab-gui-2">13.7</a>).

</p>
</div>
<p>In this terminal, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade jupyterlab-git
conda env update --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-DSCI/data-science-a-first-intro-worksheets/main/environment.yml</code></pre>
<p>The second command installs the specific R and package versions specified in
the <code>environment.yml</code> file found in
<a href="https://worksheets.datasciencebook.ca">the worksheets repository</a>.
We will always keep the versions in the <code>environment.yml</code> file updated
so that they are compatible with the exercise worksheets that accompany the book.
Once all of the software installation is complete, it is a good idea to restart
JupyterLab Desktop entirely before you proceed to doing your data analysis.
This will ensure all the software and settings you put in place are
correctly set up and ready for use.</p>

<p><strong>Installation</strong> First, we will install Git for version control.
Open the terminal (<a href="https://youtu.be/5AJbWEWwnbY">how-to video</a>)
and type the following command:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>
<p>Next, visit the <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#installation">“Installation” section of the JupyterLab Desktop homepage</a>.
Download the <code>JupyterLab-Setup-MacOS-x64.dmg</code> or <code>JupyterLab-Setup-MacOS-arm64.dmg</code> installer file.
To know which installer is right for your machine, you need to know
whether your computer has an Intel processor (older machines) or an
Apple processor (newer machines); the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT211814">Apple support page</a> has
information to help you determine which processor you have.
Once downloaded, double-click the file to open the installer, then drag
the JupyterLab Desktop icon to the Applications folder. Double-click
the icon in the Applications folder to start JupyterLab Desktop.</p>
