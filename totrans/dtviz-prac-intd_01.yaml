    the structure of the information you collect. Good data visualizations also make
    it easier to communicate your ideas and findings to other people. Beyond that,
    producing effective plots from your own data is the best way to develop a good
    eye for reading and understanding graphs—good and bad—made by others, whether
    presented in research articles, business slide decks, public policy advocacy,
    or media reports. This book teaches you how to do it.

- en: My main goal is to introduce you to both the *ideas* and the *methods* of data
    visualization in a sensible, comprehensible, reproducible way. Some classic works
    on visualizing data, such as *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*
    (Tufte, 1983), present numerous examples of good and bad work together with some
    general taste-based rules of thumb for constructing and assessing graphs. In what
    has now become a large and thriving field of research, more recent work provides
    excellent discussions of the cognitive underpinnings of successful and unsuccessful
    graphics, again providing many compelling and illuminating examples (Ware, 2008).
    Other books provide good advice about how to graph data under different circumstances
    (Cairo, 2013; Few, 2009; Munzer, 2014), but choose not to teach the reader about
    the tools used to produce the graphics they show. This may be because the software
    used is some (proprietary, costly) point-and-click application that requires a
    fully visual introduction of its own, such as Tableau, Microsoft Excel, or SPSS.
    Or perhaps the necessary software is freely available, but showing how to use
    it is not what the book is about (Cleveland, 1994). Conversely, there are excellent
    cookbooks that provide code “recipes” for many kinds of plot (Chang, 2013). But
    for that reason they do not take the time to introduce the beginner to the principles
    behind the output they produce. Finally, we also have thorough introductions to
    particular software tools and libraries, including the one we will use in this
    book (Wickham, 2016). These can sometimes be hard for beginners to digest, as
    they may presuppose a background that the reader does not have.

    how to make graphics with data, however, I have repeatedly found the need for
    an introduction that motivates and explains *why* you are doing something but
    that does not skip the necessary details of *how* to produce the images you see
    on the page. And so this book has two main aims. First, I want you get to the
    point where you can reproduce almost every figure in the text for yourself. Second,
    I want you to understand why the code is written the way it is, such that when
    you look at data of your own you can feel confident about your ability to get
    from a rough picture in your head to a high-quality graphic on your screen or
    page.

    at and presenting data using R and ggplot. R is a powerful, widely used, and freely
    available programming language for data analysis. You may be interested in exploring
    ggplot after having used R before, or be entirely new to both R and ggplot and
    just want to graph your data. I do not assume you have any prior knowledge of
    R.

    principles of visualization. We focus not just on the aesthetic aspects of good
    plots, but on how their effectiveness is rooted in the way we perceive properties
    like length, absolute and relative size, orientation, shape, and color. We then
    learn how to produce and refine plots using ggplot2, a powerful, versatile, and
    widely-used visualization library for R (Wickham, 2016). The ggplot2 library implements
    a “grammar of graphics” (Wilkinson, 2005). This approach gives us a coherent way
    to produce visualizations by expressing relationships between the attributes of
    data and their graphical representation.

    by piece, beginning with scatterplots and summaries of single variables, then
    moving on to more complex graphics. Topics covered include plotting continuous
    and categorical variables, layering information on graphics; faceting grouped
    data to produce effective “small multiple” plots; transforming data to easily
    produce visual summaries on the graph such as trend lines, linear fits, error
    ranges, and boxplots; creating maps, and also some alternatives to maps worth
    considering when presenting country- or state-level data. We will also cover cases
    where we are not working directly with a dataset, but rather with estimates from
    a statistical model. From there, we will explore the process of refining plots
    to accomplish common tasks such as highlighting key features of the data, labeling
    particular items of interest, annotating plots, and changing their overall appearance.
    Finally we will examine some strategies for presenting graphical results in different
    formats, and to different sorts of audiences.

    and techniques for manipulating data in R. In particular you will learn about
    some of the tools provided by the `tidyverse` library that ggplot belongs to.
    Similarly, although this is not a cookbook, once you get past Chapter [1](lookatdata.html#lookatdata)
    you will be able to see and understand the code used to produce almost every figure
    in the book. In most cases you will also see these figures built up piece by piece,
    a step at a time. If you use the book as it is designed, by the end you will have
    the makings of a version of the book itself, containing code you have written
    out and annotated yourself. And though we do not go into great depth on the topic
    of rules or principles of visualization, the discussion in Chapter [1](lookatdata.html#lookatdata)
    and its application throughout the book gives you more to think about than just
    a list of graph types. By the end of the book you should be able to look at a
    figure and be able to see it in terms of ggplot’s grammar, understanding how the
    various layers, shapes, and data are pieced together to make a finished plot.

- en: It can be a little disorienting to learn a programming language like R, mostly
    because at the beginning there seem to be so many pieces to fit together in order
    for things to work properly. It can seem like you have to learn everything before
    you can do anything. The language has some possibly unfamiliar concepts that define
    how it works, like “object”, or “function”, or “class”. The syntactic rules for
    writing code are annoyingly picky. Error messages seem obscure; help pages are
    terse; other people seem to have had *not quite* the same issue as you. Beyond
    that, you sense that doing one thing often involves learning a bit about some
    other part of the language. To make a plot you need a table of data, but maybe
    you need to filter out some rows, recalculate some columns, or just get the computer
    to see it is there in the first place. And there is also a wider environment of
    supporting applications and tools that are good to know about, but involve new
    concepts of their own—editors that highlight what you write; applications that
    help you organize your code and its output; ways of writing your code that let
    you keep track of what you have done. It can all seem a bit confusing.

    in this area, you will gradually see the other tools as things that help you sort
    out some issue, or solve a problem that’s stopping you from making the picture
    you want. That makes them easier to learn. As you acquire them piecemeal—perhaps
    initially using them without completely understanding what is happening—you will

    through the examplesOr if you bring your own data to explore instead of or alongside
    the examples, as described in Chapter 2., then you will end up with a data visualization
    book of your own. If you approach the book this way, then by the end you will
    be comfortable using ggplot in particular and also be ready to learn more about
    the R language in general.

    on data visualization or as a supplement to undergraduate or graduate courses
    in statistics or data analysis. My aim has been to make the “hidden tasks” of
    coding and polishing graphs more accessible and explicit. I want to make sure
    you are not left with the “How to Draw an Owl in Three Steps” problem common to
    many tutorials. You know the one. The first two steps are shown clearly enough.
    Sketch a few bird-shaped ovals. Make a line for a branch. But the final step,
    an owl such as John James Audubon might have drawn, is presented as a simple extension
    for readers to figure out for themselves.

    book and work your way through to the end. If you know about R already but only
    want to learn the core of ggplot, then after installing the software descibed
    below, focus on Chapters 3 through 5. Chapter 6 (on models) necessarily incorporates
    some material on statistical modeling that the book cannot develop fully. This
    is not a statistics text. So, for example, I show generally how to fit and work
    with various kinds of model in Chapter 6, but I do not go through the important
    details of fitting, selecting, and fully understanding different approaches. I
    provide references in the text to other books that have this material as their
    main focus.

    ask questions or pose some challenges that extend the material covered in the
    chapter, encouraging you to use the concepts and skills you have learned.

    that you can type and run yourself, and the output of that code. In the main text,
    references to objects or other things that exist in the R language or in your
    R project—like tables of data, variables, functions, and so on—will also appear
    in `a monospaced or "typewriter" typeface`. Code you can type directly into R
    at the console will be in gray boxes, and also monospaced. Like this:'

    that also produces output at the console, we will first see the code (in a gray

    that comes back to us at the console as the result of typing a command will be
    shown prefaced by two hash characters (`##`) at the beginning of each line of
    output. This is to help distinguish it from commands we type into the console.
    You will not see the hash characters at the console when you use R.

    results in a series of elements (like numbers, or observations from a variable,
    and so on) you will often see output that includes some number in square brackets
    at the beginning of the line. It looks like this: `[1]`. This is not part of the
    output itself, but just a counter or index keeping track of how many items have
    been printed out so far. In the case of adding `4 + 1` we got just one, or `[1]`,
    thing back—the number five. If there are more elements returned as the result
    of some instruction or command, the counter will keep track of that on each line.
    In this next bit of code we will tell R to show us the lower-case letters of the
    alphabet:'
