- en: Since the publication of this book in July 2023, there have been a variety of
    changes in the world. The rise of generative AI has changed the way that people
    code, Python has become easier to integrate alongside R because of Quarto, and
    packages continue to update (not to mention a new cohort of students has started
    going through the book). One advantage of having an online version is that I can
    make improvements.
