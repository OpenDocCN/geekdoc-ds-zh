- en: So far, we have introduced all core components necessary to build a complete
    and physically plausible MPM simulation system—including material discretization,
    time integration, and data transfer schemes.

- en: In this case study, we put these components together to simulate two colliding
    elastic blocks in 2D. We start by [setting up](./lec29.1-simulation_setup.html)
    the simulation with material properties and data structure definitions. Then,
    we implement the [Particle-In-Cell (PIC) Transfer](./lec29.2-pic_transfer.html)
    to handle momentum exchange between particles and the grid.

    elastic materials, without plasticity or complex boundary conditions.

- en: For implementation, we use NumPy and [Taichi](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/)
    as our programming framework. Taichi provides efficient parallelism on both CPU
    and GPU, and more importantly, it supports [sparse data structures]((https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/sparse)),
    which are critical for high-performance MPM grid computations.
