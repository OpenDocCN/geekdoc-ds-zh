The
game won’t be sophisticated, but it’ll have all the elements you need
to build much richer games of your own.</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><img src="../Images/998e83245f5c413f941ee7fad3ab6d30.png" alt="" width="151" height="201" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/balloon-fiesta.png"/>
<br/>
Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta</p></blockquote><p>Imagine we have an airplane coming in to land. It’s unfortunately
trying to do so amidst a hot-air balloon festival, so it naturally
wants to avoid colliding with any (moving) balloons. In addition,
there is both land and water, and the airplane needs to alight on
land. We might also equip it with limited amounts of fuel to complete
its task. Here are some animations of the game:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RyDtWXnodN1rzUwwe79InaVUTfIW5GC8/view?usp=share_link">The airplane comes in to land succcessfully.</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N8H8T4ssaIlzGfL8XD99QruxLlrIAnAu/view?usp=sharing">Uh oh—<wbr/>the airplane collides with a balloon!</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdlxGY8InPkyYRWi3ROWDHLZPtuj2KZu/view?usp=share_link">Uh oh—<wbr/>the airplane lands in the water!</a></p></li></ul><p>By the end, you will have written all the relevant portions of this
program. Your program will:
</p><ul><li><p>animate the airplane to move autonomously;</p></li><li><p>detect keystrokes and adjust the airplane accordingly;</p></li><li><p>have multiple moving balloons;</p></li><li><p>detect collisions between the airplane and balloons;</p></li><li><p>check for landing on water and land; and</p></li><li><p>account for the use of fuel.</p></li></ul><p>Phew: that’s a lot going on! Therefore, we won’t write it all at
once; instead, we’ll build it up bit-by-bit. But we’ll get there by
the end.</p><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 27.1"><h3 class="heading">27.1 <a name="(part._.About_.Reactive_.Animations)"/>About Reactive Animations<a href="#(part._.About_.Reactive_.Animations)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>We are writing a program with two important interactive elements: it
is an animation, meaning it gives the impression of motion, and
it is reactive, meaning it responds to user input. Both of these
can be challenging to program, but Pyret provides a simple mechanism
that accommodates both and integrates well with other programming
principles such as testing. We will learn about this as we go along.</p><p>The key to creating an animation is the Movie Principle. Even in
the most sophisticated movie you can watch, there is no motion
(indeed, the very term “movie”—<wbr/>short for “moving picture”—<wbr/>is a
clever bit of false advertising). Rather, there is just a sequence of
still images shown in rapid succession, relying on the human brain to
create the impression of motion:
</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><img src="../Images/5c8adbce3d9a918184e456af57b76f30.png" alt="" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/filmstrip.jpg"/></p></blockquote><p>We are going to exploit the same idea: our animations will consist of
a sequence of individual images, and we will ask Pyret to show these
in rapid succession. We will then see how reactivity folds into the
same process.</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 27.2"><h3 class="heading">27.2 <a name="(part._.Preliminaries)"/>Preliminaries<a href="#(part._.Preliminaries)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>To begin with, we should inform Pyret that we plan to make use of both
images and animations. We load the libraries as follows:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">import image as I
import reactors as R</code></pre><p>This tells Pyret to load these two libraries and bind the results
to the corresponding names, <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">I</code> and <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">R</code>. Thus, all image
operations are obtained from <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">I</code> and animation operations from
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">R</code>.</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 27.3"><h3 class="heading">27.3 <a name="(part._.Version__.Airplane_.Moving_.Across_the_.Screen)"/>Version: Airplane Moving Across the Screen<a href="#(part._.Version__.Airplane_.Moving_.Across_the_.Screen)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>We will start with the simplest version: one in which the airplane
moves horizontally across the screen. Watch
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rbDJJJEQV2z-FZT3R1c15xelLsCwhaLI/view?usp=share_link">this video</a>.</p><p>First, here’s an image of an airplane:Have fun finding
your preferred airplane image! But don’t spend too long on it,
because we’ve still got a lot of work to do.</p><p><a href="http://world.cs.brown.edu/1/clipart/airplane-small.png">http://world.cs.brown.edu/1/clipart/airplane-small.png</a></p><p>We can tell Pyret to load this image and give it a name as follows:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">AIRPLANE-URL =
  "http://world.cs.brown.edu/1/clipart/airplane-small.png"
AIRPLANE = I.image-url(AIRPLANE-URL)</code></pre><p>Henceforth, when we refer to <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">AIRPLANE</code>, it will always refer to
this image. (Try it out in the interactions area!)</p><p>Now look at the video again. Watch what happens at different points in
time. What stays the same, and what changes? What’s common is the
water and land, which stay the same. What changes is the (horizontal)
position of the airplane.</p><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>The World State consists of everything that changes. Things
that stay the same do not need to get recorded in the World
State.</p></blockquote><p>We can now define our first World State:</p><p>World Definition</p><blockquote class="WorldDef"><p>The World State is a number, representing the x-position
of the airplane.</p></blockquote><p>Observe something important above:</p><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>When we record a World State, we don’t capture only the type of the
values, but also their intended meaning.</p></blockquote><p>Now we have a representation of the core data, but to generate the
above animation, we still have to do several things:
</p><ol><li><p>Ask to be notified of the passage of time.</p></li><li><p>As time passes, correspondingly update the World State.</p></li><li><p>Given an updated World State, produce the corresponding visual
display.</p></li></ol><p>This sounds like a lot! Fortunately, Pyret makes this much easier than
it sounds. We’ll do these in a slightly different order than listed
above.</p><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 27.3.1"><h4 class="heading">27.3.1 <a name="(part._.Updating_the_.World_.State)"/>Updating the World State<a href="#(part._.Updating_the_.World_.State)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>As we’ve noted, the airplane doesn’t actually “move”. Rather, we can
ask Pyret to notify us every time a clock ticks. If on each
tick we place the airplane in an appropriately different position, and
the ticks happen often enough, we will get the impression of motion.</p><p>Because the World State consists of just the airplane’s
x-position, to move it to the right, we simply increment
its value. Let’s first give this constant distance a name:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">AIRPLANE-X-MOVE = 10</code></pre><p>We will need to write a function that reflects this movement. Let’s
first write some test cases:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">check:
  move-airplane-x-on-tick(50) is 50 + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE
  move-airplane-x-on-tick(0) is 0 + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE
  move-airplane-x-on-tick(100) is 100 + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE
end</code></pre><p>The function’s definition is now clear:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-x-on-tick(w):
  w + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE
end</code></pre><p>And sure enough, Pyret will confirm that this function passes all of
its tests.</p><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>If you have prior experience programming animations and reactive
programs, you will immediately notice an important difference: it’s
easy to test parts of your program in Pyret!</p></blockquote></section><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 27.3.2"><h4 class="heading">27.3.2 <a name="(part._.Displaying_the_.World_.State)"/>Displaying the World State<a href="#(part._.Displaying_the_.World_.State)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>Now we’re ready to draw the game’s visual output. We produce an image
that consists of all the necessary components. It first helps to
define some constants representing the visual output:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 500

BASE-HEIGHT = 50
WATER-WIDTH = 500</code></pre><p>Using these, we can create a blank canvas, and overlay rectangles
representing water and land:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">BLANK-SCENE = I.empty-scene(WIDTH, HEIGHT)

WATER = I.rectangle(WATER-WIDTH, BASE-HEIGHT, "solid", "blue")
LAND = I.rectangle(WIDTH - WATER-WIDTH, BASE-HEIGHT, "solid", "brown")

BASE = I.beside(WATER, LAND)

BACKGROUND =
  I.place-image(BASE,
    WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT - (BASE-HEIGHT / 2),
    BLANK-SCENE)</code></pre><p>Examine the value of <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">BACKGROUND</code> in the interactions area
to confirm that it looks right.</p><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>The reason we divide by two when placing <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">BASE</code> is because
Pyret puts the middle of the image at the given
location. Remove the division and see what happens to the resulting
image.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Now that we know how to get our background, we’re ready to place the
airplane on it. The expression to do so looks roughly like this:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">I.place-image(AIRPLANE,
  # some x position,
  50,
  BACKGROUND)</code></pre><p>but what x position do we use? Actually, that’s just what
the World State represents! So we create a function out of this
expression:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun place-airplane-x(w):
  I.place-image(AIRPLANE,
    w,
    50,
    BACKGROUND)
end</code></pre></section><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 27.3.3"><h4 class="heading">27.3.3 <a name="(part._.Observing_.Time__and_.Combining_the_.Pieces_)"/>Observing Time (and Combining the Pieces)<a href="#(part._.Observing_.Time__and_.Combining_the_.Pieces_)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>Finally, we’re ready to put these pieces together.</p><p>We create a special kind of Pyret value called a reactor, which
creates animations. We’ll start by creating a fairly simple kind of
reactor, then grow it as the program gets more sophisticated.</p><p>The following code creates a reactor named <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">anim</code>:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">anim = reactor:
  init: 0,
  on-tick: move-airplane-x-on-tick,
  to-draw: place-airplane-x
end</code></pre><p>A reactor needs to be given an initial World State
as well as handlers that tell it how to react. Specifying
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">on-tick</code> tells Pyret to run a clock and, every time the clock
ticks (roughly thirty times a second), invoke the associated
handler. The <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">to-draw</code> handler is used by Pyret to refresh the
visual display.</p><p>Having defined this reactor, we can run it in several ways that are
useful for finding errors, running scientific experiments, and so
on. Our needs here are simple; we ask Pyret to just run the program
on the screen interactively:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">R.interact(anim)</code></pre><p>This creates a running program where the airplane flies across the background!</p><p>That’s it! We’ve created our first animation. Now that we’ve gotten
all the preliminaries out of the way, we can go about enhancing it.</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>If you want the airplane to appear to move faster, what can you change?</p></blockquote></blockquote></section></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 27.4"><h3 class="heading">27.4 <a name="(part._.Version__.Wrapping_.Around)"/>Version: Wrapping Around<a href="#(part._.Version__.Wrapping_.Around)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>When you run the preceding program, you’ll notice that after a while,
the airplane just disappears. This is because it has gone past the right
edge of the screen; it is still being “drawn”, but in a location
that you cannot see. That’s not very useful!Also, after
a long while you might get an error because the computer is being
asked to draw the airplane at a location beyond what the graphics
system can manage. Instead, when the airplane is about to go past the
right edge of the screen, we’d like it to reappear on the left by a
corresponding amount: “wrapping around”, as it were.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zL4PY1vOWgFMBuPmMvr8wixh5VE9Pg_r/view?usp=share_link">Here’s the video for this version.</a></p><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>What needs to change?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Clearly, we need to modify
the function that updates the airplane’s location, since this must now
reflect our decision to wrap around. But the task of how to draw
the airplane doesn’t need to change at all! Similarly, the definition of
the World State does not need to change, either.</p><p>Therefore, we only need to modify <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-x-on-tick</code>. The
function <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">num-modulo</code> does exactly what we need. That is, we want
the x-location to always be modulo the width of the scene:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick(x):
  num-modulo(x + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE, WIDTH)
end</code></pre><p>Notice that, instead of copying the content of the previous definition
we can simply reuse it:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick(x):
  num-modulo(move-airplane-x-on-tick(x), WIDTH)
end</code></pre><p>which makes our intent clearer: compute whatever position we would
have had before, but adapt the coordinate to remain within the scene’s
width.</p><p>Well, that’s a proposed re-definition. Be sure to test this
function thoroughly: it’s tricker than you might think! Have you
thought about all the cases? For instance, what happens if the airplane
is half-way off the right edge of the screen?</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Define quality tests for <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick</code>.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>It is possible to leave <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-x-on-tick</code> unchanged
and perform the modular arithmetic in <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">place-airplane-x</code>
instead. We choose not to do that for the following reason. In this
version, we really do think of the airplane as circling around and
starting again from the left edge (imagine the world is a
cylinder...). Thus, the airplane’s x-position really does
keep going back down. If instead we allowed the World State to
increase monotonically, then it would really be representing the total
distance traveled, contradicting our definition of the World State.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>After adding this function, run your program again. Did you see any
change in behavior?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>If you didn’t…did you remember to update your reactor to use the new
airplane-moving function?</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel3" id="section 27.5"><h3 class="heading">27.5 <a name="(part._.Version__.Descending)"/>Version: Descending<a href="#(part._.Version__.Descending)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h3><p>Of course, we need our airplane to move in more than just one dimension:
to get to the final game, it must both ascend and descend as well. For
now, we’ll focus on the simplest version of this, which is an airplane
that continuously descends.
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJ7eJ7Uv-YCXm87OKH5obAYFXp1pAnZo/view?usp=share_link">Here’s a video.</a></p><p>Let’s again consider individual frames of this video. What’s staying
the same? Once again, the water and the land. What’s changing? The
position of the airplane. But, whereas before the airplane moved only
in the x-dimension, now it moves in both x and
y. That immediately tells us that our definition of the
World State is inadequate, and must be modified.</p><p>We therefore define a new structure to hold this pair of data:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">data Posn:
  | posn(x, y)
end</code></pre><p>Given this, we can revise our definition:</p><p>World Definition</p><blockquote class="WorldDef"><p>The World State is a <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">posn</code>, representing the
x-position and y-position of the airplane on
the screen.</p></blockquote><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 27.5.1"><h4 class="heading">27.5.1 <a name="(part._.Moving_the_.Airplane)"/>Moving the Airplane<a href="#(part._.Moving_the_.Airplane)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>First, let’s consider
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick</code>. Previously our airplane moved
only in the x-direction; now we want it to descend as
well, which means we must add something to the current y
value:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">AIRPLANE-Y-MOVE = 3</code></pre><p>Let’s write some test cases for the new function. Here’s one:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">check:
  move-airplane-xy-on-tick(posn(10, 10)) is posn(20, 13)
end</code></pre><p>Another way to write the test would be:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">check:
  p = posn(10, 10)
  move-airplane-xy-on-tick(p) is
    posn(move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick(p.x),
      move-airplane-y-on-tick(p.y))
end</code></pre><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>Which method of writing tests is better? Both! They each offer
different advantages:
</p><ul><li><p>The former method has the benefit of being very concrete:
there’s no question what you expect, and it demonstrates that you
really can compute the desired answer from first principles.</p></li><li><p>The latter method has the advantage that, if you change the
constants in your program (such as the rate of descent), seemingly
correct tests do not suddenly fail. That is, this form of testing is
more about the relationships between things rather than their
precise values.</p></li></ul><p>There is one more choice available, which often combines the best of
both worlds: write the answer as concretely as possible (the former
style), but using constants to compute the answer (the advantage
of the latter style). For instance:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">check:
  p = posn(10, 10)
  move-airplane-xy-on-tick(p) is
   posn(num-modulo(p.x + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE, WIDTH),
    p.y + AIRPLANE-Y-MOVE)
end</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Before you proceed, have you written enough test cases? Are you sure?
Have you, for instance, tested what should happen when the airplane is
near the edge of the screen in either or both dimensions? We thought
not—<wbr/>go back and write more tests before you proceed!</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Using the design recipe, now define <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-xy-on-tick</code>. You
should end up with something like this:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-xy-on-tick(w):
  posn(move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick(w.x),

x-dimension and, correspondingly, created a helper for the
y dimension:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-y-on-tick(y):
  y + AIRPLANE-Y-MOVE
end</code></pre><p>This may be slight overkill for now, but it does lead to a cleaner
separation of concerns, and makes it possible for the complexity
of movement in each dimension to evolve independently while keeping
the code relatively readable.</p></section><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 27.5.2"><h4 class="heading">27.5.2 <a name="(part._.Drawing_the_.Scene)"/>Drawing the Scene<a href="#(part._.Drawing_the_.Scene)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>We have to also examine and update <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">place-airplane-x</code>.

consume and produce World State and updated them

In our simplified world, fuel
isn’t necessary to descend—<wbr/>gravity does that automatically—<wbr/>but it
is needed to climb. We’ll assume that fuel is counted in whole number
units, and every ascension consumes one unit of fuel. When you run out
of fuel, the program no longer responds to the up-arrow, so you can no
longer avoid either the balloon or water.</p><p>In the past, we’ve looked at still images of the game video to
determine what is changing and what isn’t.  For this version, we could
easily place a little gauge on the screen to show the quantity of fuel
left. However, we don’t on purpose, to illustrate a principle.</p><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>You can’t always determine what is fixed and what is changing just by
looking at the image.  You have to also read the problem statement
carefully, and think about it in depth.</p></blockquote><p>It’s clear from our description that there are two things changing:
the position of the airplane and the quantity of fuel left. Therefore,
the World State must capture the current values of both of these. The
fuel is best represented as a single number. However, we do need to
create a new structure to represent the combination of these two.</p><p>World Definition</p><blockquote class="WorldDef"><p>The World State is a structure representing the airplane’s current
position and the quantity of fuel left.</p></blockquote><p>Concretely, we will use this structure:

what can stay the same and what changes. Concretely, we must focus on
the functions that consume and produce <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">World</code>s.</p><p>On each tick, we consume a world and compute one. The passage of time
does not consume any fuel, so this code can remain unchanged, other
than having to create a structure containing the current amount of
fuel. Concretely:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-xy-on-tick(w :: World):

can be challenging to program, but Pyret provides a simple mechanism
that accommodates both and integrates well with other programming
principles such as testing. We will learn about this as we go along.</p><p>The key to creating an animation is the Movie Principle. Even in
the most sophisticated movie you can watch, there is no motion
(indeed, the very term “movie”—<wbr/>short for “moving picture”—<wbr/>is a
clever bit of false advertising). Rather, there is just a sequence of
still images shown in rapid succession, relying on the human brain to
create the impression of motion:

corresponding amount: “wrapping around”, as it were.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zL4PY1vOWgFMBuPmMvr8wixh5VE9Pg_r/view?usp=share_link">Here’s the video for this version.</a></p><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>What needs to change?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Clearly, we need to modify
the function that updates the airplane’s location, since this must now
reflect our decision to wrap around. But the task of how to draw
the airplane doesn’t need to change at all! Similarly, the definition of
the World State does not need to change, either.</p><p>Therefore, we only need to modify <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-x-on-tick</code>. The
function <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">num-modulo</code> does exactly what we need. That is, we want
the x-location to always be modulo the width of the scene:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick(x):
  num-modulo(x + AIRPLANE-X-MOVE, WIDTH)

  num-modulo(move-airplane-x-on-tick(x), WIDTH)
end</code></pre><p>which makes our intent clearer: compute whatever position we would
have had before, but adapt the coordinate to remain within the scene’s
width.</p><p>Well, that’s a proposed re-definition. Be sure to test this
function thoroughly: it’s tricker than you might think! Have you
thought about all the cases? For instance, what happens if the airplane
is half-way off the right edge of the screen?</p><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>Define quality tests for <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick</code>.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>It is possible to leave <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">move-airplane-x-on-tick</code> unchanged

version, we really do think of the airplane as circling around and
starting again from the left edge (imagine the world is a
cylinder...). Thus, the airplane’s x-position really does
keep going back down. If instead we allowed the World State to
increase monotonically, then it would really be representing the total
distance traveled, contradicting our definition of the World State.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>After adding this function, run your program again. Did you see any

to get to the final game, it must both ascend and descend as well. For
now, we’ll focus on the simplest version of this, which is an airplane

ascend as well.

will make it move up, while the down-key will make it descend even
faster. This is easy to support using what we already know: we just
need to provide one more handler using <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">on-key</code>. This handler
takes two arguments: the first is the current value of the
world, while the second is a representation of which key was
pressed. For the purposes of this program, the only key values we care
about are <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"up"</code> and <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">"down"</code>.</p><p>This gives us a fairly comprehensive view of the core capabilities of
reactors:
</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><img src="../Images/4925a999ce7daf16dda269c55117e5c5.png" alt="" data-original-src="https://dcic-world.org/2025-08-27/world-automaton.jpg"/></p></blockquote><p>We just define a group of functions to perform all our desired
actions, and the reactor strings them together. Some functions update
world values (sometimes taking additional information about a
stimulus, such as the key pressed), while others transform them into
output (such as what we see on the screen).</p><p>Returning to our program, let’s define a constant representing how
much distance a key represents:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">KEY-DISTANCE = 10</code></pre><p>Now we can define a function that alter’s the airplane’s position by that
distance depending on which key is pressed:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun alter-airplane-y-on-key(w, key):
  ask:
    | key == "up"   then: posn(w.x, w.y - KEY-DISTANCE)

    | otherwise: w

</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">| otherwise: w</code></pre><p>as its last condition?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Notice that if we receive any key other than the two we expect, we
leave the World State as it was; from the user’s perspective, this has
the effect of just ignoring the keystroke. Remove this last clause,
press some other key, and watch what happens!</p><p>No matter what you choose, be sure to test this! Can the airplane drift
off the top of the screen? How about off the screen at the bottom? Can
it overlap with the land or water?</p><p>Once we’ve written and thoroughly tested this function, we simply need
to ask Pyret to use it to handle keystrokes:

  on-tick: move-airplane-xy-on-tick,

keep it airborne indefinitely. That means we need to detect when the

means writing a function that consumes the current World State and
produces a boolean value: <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">true</code> if the animation should halt,
<code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">false</code> otherwise. This requires a little arithmetic based on the

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLt9tdt2sSPWR90-mmMLCDW4ZklgR_lN/view?usp=share_link">Here’s a video of the action.</a></p><p>Notice that while the airplane moves, everything else—<wbr/>including the
balloon—<wbr/>stays immobile. Therefore, we do not need to alter the World
State to record the balloon’s position. All we need to do is alter the
conditions under which the program halts: effectively, there is one
more situation under which it terminates, and that is a collision with
the balloon.</p><p>When does the game halt? There are now two circumstances: one is
contact with land or water, and the other is contact with the
balloon. The former remains unchanged from what it was before, so we can
focus on the latter.</p><p>Where is the balloon, and how do we represent where it is? The latter
is easy to answer: that’s what <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">posn</code>s are good for. As for the
former, we can decide where it is:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">BALLOON-LOC = posn(600, 300)</code></pre><p>or we can let Pyret pick a random position:

spaces (e.g., not submerged).</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Given a position for the balloon, we just need to detect
collision. One simple way is as follows: determine whether the
distance between the airplane and the balloon is within some threshold:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun are-overlapping(airplane-posn, balloon-posn):
  distance(airplane-posn, balloon-posn)
    &lt; COLLISION-THRESHOLD
end</code></pre><p>where <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">COLLISION-THRESHOLD</code> is some suitable constant computed
based on the sizes of the airplane and balloon images. (For these
particular images, <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">75</code> works pretty well.)</p><p>What is <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">distance</code>? It consumes two <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">posn</code>s and determines
the Euclidean distance between them:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun distance(p1, p2):
  fun square(n): n * n end
  num-sqrt(square(p1.x - p2.x) + square(p1.y - p2.y))
end</code></pre><p>Finally, we have to weave together the two termination conditions:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun game-ends(w):
  ask:
    | is-on-land-or-water(w)          then: true
    | are-overlapping(w, BALLOON-LOC) then: true
    | otherwise: false

In our simplified world, fuel
isn’t necessary to descend—<wbr/>gravity does that automatically—<wbr/>but it
is needed to climb. We’ll assume that fuel is counted in whole number
units, and every ascension consumes one unit of fuel. When you run out
of fuel, the program no longer responds to the up-arrow, so you can no
longer avoid either the balloon or water.</p><p>In the past, we’ve looked at still images of the game video to
determine what is changing and what isn’t.  For this version, we could
easily place a little gauge on the screen to show the quantity of fuel
left. However, we don’t on purpose, to illustrate a principle.</p><p>Note</p><blockquote class="Note"><p>You can’t always determine what is fixed and what is changing just by
looking at the image.  You have to also read the problem statement
carefully, and think about it in depth.</p></blockquote><p>It’s clear from our description that there are two things changing:
the position of the airplane and the quantity of fuel left. Therefore,
the World State must capture the current values of both of these. The
fuel is best represented as a single number. However, we do need to
create a new structure to represent the combination of these two.</p><p>World Definition</p><blockquote class="WorldDef"><p>The World State is a structure representing the airplane’s current
position and the quantity of fuel left.</p></blockquote><p>Concretely, we will use this structure:

  | world(p, f)
end</code></pre><blockquote class="Exercise"><p class="ExerciseHeader">Exercise</p><blockquote class="ExerciseBody"><p>We could have also defined the World to be a structure consisting of
three components: the airplane’s x-position, the
airplane’s y-position, and the quantity of fuel. Why do we
choose to use the representation above?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>We can again look at each of the parts of the program to determine
what can stay the same and what changes. Concretely, we must focus on
the functions that consume and produce <code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">World</code>s.</p><p>On each tick, we consume a world and compute one. The passage of time
does not consume any fuel, so this code can remain unchanged, other
than having to create a structure containing the current amount of
fuel. Concretely:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun move-airplane-xy-on-tick(w :: World):
  world(
    posn(
      move-airplane-wrapping-x-on-tick(w.p.x),
      move-airplane-y-on-tick(w.p.y)),
    w.f)
end</code></pre><p>Similarly, the function that responds to keystrokes clearly needs to
take into account how much fuel is left:
</p><pre data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="pyret" class="sourceCode">fun alter-airplane-y-on-key(w, key):
