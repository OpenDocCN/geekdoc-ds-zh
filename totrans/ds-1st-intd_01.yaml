- en: The field of data science has expanded and grown significantly in recent years,
    attracting excitement and interest from many different directions. The demand
    for introductory educational materials has grown concurrently with the growth
    of the field itself, leading to a proliferation of textbooks, courses, blog posts,
    and tutorials. This book is an important contribution to this fast-growing literature,
    but given the wide availability of materials, a reader should be inclined to ask,
    “What is the unique contribution of *this* book?” In order to answer that question
    it is useful to step back for a moment and consider the development of the field
    of data science over the past few years.

  zh: 近年来，数据科学领域已经显著扩展和增长，吸引了来自不同方向的兴奋和兴趣。随着该领域本身的发展，对入门教育材料的需求也在增长，导致教科书、课程、博客文章和教程的激增。这本书是对这一快速增长的文献的重要贡献，但鉴于材料的广泛可用性，读者可能会倾向于问：“这本书的独特贡献是什么？”为了回答这个问题，暂时回顾一下过去几年数据科学领域的发展是有用的。
- en: 'When thinking about data science, it is important to consider two questions:
    “What is data science?” and “How should one do data science?” The former question
    is under active discussion amongst a broad community of researchers and practitioners
    and there does not appear to be much consensus to date. However, there seems a
    general understanding that data science focuses on the more “active” elements—data
    wrangling, cleaning, and analysis—of answering questions with data. These elements
    are often highly problem-specific and may seem difficult to generalize across
    applications. Nevertheless, over time we have seen some core elements emerge that
    appear to repeat themselves as useful concepts across different problems. Given
    the lack of clear agreement over the definition of data science, there is a strong
    need for a book like this one to propose a vision for what the field is and what
    the implications are for the activities in which members of the field engage.'

  zh: 当思考数据科学时，考虑两个问题是重要的：“什么是数据科学？”以及“一个人应该如何进行数据科学？”前一个问题在广泛的学者和实践者社区中正在积极讨论，目前似乎还没有达成太多共识。然而，似乎有一个普遍的理解，即数据科学专注于用数据回答问题的更“活跃”的元素——数据处理、清洗和分析。这些元素通常高度特定于问题，可能看起来难以在不同应用中推广。尽管如此，随着时间的推移，我们已经看到一些核心元素出现，这些元素似乎在不同问题中作为有用的概念重复出现。鉴于对数据科学定义的缺乏明确共识，迫切需要像这样一本书来提出对这一领域是什么以及该领域成员参与的活动的影响的愿景。
- en: The first important concept addressed by this book is tidy data, which is a
    format for tabular data formally introduced to the statistical community in a
    2014 paper by Hadley Wickham. The tidy data organization strategy has proven a
    powerful abstract concept for conducting data analysis, in large part because
    of the vast toolchain implemented in the Tidyverse collection of R packages. The
    second key concept is the development of workflows for reproducible and auditable
    data analyses. Modern data analyses have only grown in complexity due to the availability
    of data and the ease with which we can implement complex data analysis procedures.
    Furthermore, these data analyses are often part of decision-making processes that
    may have significant impacts on people and communities. Therefore, there is a
    critical need to build reproducible analyses that can be studied and repeated
    by others in a reliable manner. Statistical methods clearly represent an important
    element of data science for building prediction and classification models and
    for making inferences about unobserved populations. Finally, because a field can
    succeed only if it fosters an active and collaborative community, it has become
    clear that being fluent in the tools of collaboration is a core element of data
    science.

  zh: 本书首先讨论的重要概念是tidy数据，这是一种表格数据的格式，由Hadley Wickham在2014年的一篇论文中正式介绍给统计社区。tidy数据组织策略已被证明是进行数据分析的有力抽象概念，这在很大程度上得益于Tidyverse集合中R包的庞大工具链。第二个关键概念是开发可重复和可审计的数据分析工作流程。由于数据可用性和我们实施复杂数据分析程序容易，现代数据分析的复杂性不断增加。此外，这些数据分析往往是决策过程的一部分，可能对个人和社区产生重大影响。因此，构建可重复的分析，其他人可以以可靠的方式研究和重复，变得至关重要。统计方法显然是数据科学中构建预测和分类模型以及做出关于未观察人群推断的重要元素。最后，因为一个领域只有在其培养一个活跃和协作的社区时才能成功，因此很明显，熟练掌握协作工具是数据科学的核心要素。
- en: This book takes these core concepts and focuses on how one can apply them to
    *do* data science in a rigorous manner. Students who learn from this book will
    be well-versed in the techniques and principles behind producing reliable evidence
    from data. This book is centered around the use of the R programming language
    within the tidy data framework, and as such employs the most recent advances in
    data analysis coding. The use of Jupyter notebooks for exercises immediately places
    the student in an environment that encourages auditability and reproducibility
    of analyses. The integration of git and GitHub into the course is a key tool for
    teaching about collaboration and community, key concepts that are critical to
    data science.

  zh: 这本书将这些核心概念集中在如何以严谨的方式将它们应用于*做*数据科学。从这本书学习的学生将精通从数据中产生可靠证据的技术和原则。本书以在tidy数据框架内使用R编程语言为中心，因此采用了数据分析编码的最新进展。使用Jupyter笔记本进行练习立即将学生置于一个鼓励分析可审计性和可重复性的环境中。将git和GitHub整合到课程中是教授协作和社区的关键工具，这些是数据科学中至关重要的概念。
- en: The demand for training in data science continues to increase. The availability
    of large quantities of data to answer a variety of questions, the computational
    power available to many more people than ever before, and the public awareness
    of the importance of data for decision-making have all contributed to the need
    for high-quality data science work. This book provides a sophisticated first introduction
    to the field of data science and provides a balanced mix of practical skills along
    with generalizable principles. As we continue to introduce students to data science
    and train them to confront an expanding array of data science problems, they will
    be well-served by the ideas presented here.
