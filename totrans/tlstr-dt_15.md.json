seeks to develop systematic measures of the policy agenda of British government and politics over time. It applies the policy content coding system of the original Policy Agendas Project in the United States, founded by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones, with the aim of creating a consistent record of the issues that are attended to at different points in time, across many of the main venues of British public policy and politics – namely in parliament, the media and public opinion. The reliability of these measures of policy attention are ensured through adherence to clearly defined coding rules and standards, which give us confidence that changes in the priorities of government can be tracked consistently over time and in different arenas of politics.

The goal of the Archive is to enable case research on Chinese domestic matters and China–U.S. relations, as well as to facilitate the inclusion of China in more broadly comparative studies. To that end, the Archive’s mission includes: acquiring and maintaining extant data sets and data sources on an ongoing basis, facilitating production of quantitative data from textual information when such is desirable and feasible, making all of the Archive’s data available on a user-friendly basis to scholars at and visiting Texas A&M University, and establishing web-based links to searchable electronic sources of information on China. As long-term goals, The China Archive is especially dedicated to: locating and acquiring difficult-to-obtain Chinese data such as public opinion data, making as many of the holdings as possible available online or via other computer media, and providing capability for converting textual data to numerical data suitable for quantitative analysis. In keeping with these goals, the Archive includes data sets collected by individuals and research centers/institutes as well as by government agencies. The Archive was planned by a faculty committee in 2002–2003, and is now a project of the Texas A&M University Libraries. A faculty committee continues to function as an advisory committee to the Libraries on matters related to the upkeep and expansion of The China Archive. The faculty committee is, in turn, advised by an External Advisory Panel, composed of China scholars from other academic institutions in the United States.

Some details are listed below. Data is forthcoming. Decisions of the High Court of Australia This dataset contains information on every case decided by the High Court of Australia between the years 1970 and 2015\\. Cases serve as the unit of analysis. Each case was coded in terms of its policy content and several other variables controlling for the nature of the case and the nature of the court. In coding for policy content, we utilized the Comparative Agendas Project’s topics coding scheme, where each case was assigned both a major topic and a sub topic depending on its policy content. A full description of these categories and their corresponding codes may be found in the codebook. Sydney Morning Herald - Front Page Articles This dataset contains information on each article published on the Sydney Morning Herald's front page for each day from 1990 through 2015\\. Front page articles serve as the unit of analysis. Each article was coded in terms of its policy content and other variables of interest controlling for location, political context, and key actors. In coding for policy content, we utilized the Comparative Agendas Project’s major topics coding scheme, where each article was assigned a major topic code. A full description of the policy content categories and their corresponding codes may be found in the major topics codebook. Dr. Keith Dowding (ANU), Dr. Aaron Martin (Melbourne), and Dr. Rhonda Evans (UT-Austin) lead the Australian Policy Agendas Project. Dr. Dowding and Dr. Martin coded legislation, executive speeches, opposition questions, public opinion, and media data, and Dr. Evans collected data on decisions of the High Court of Australia as well as additional media data.

V první vlně sběru dat, která proběhla od července do prosince 2015, bylo dotázáno 5 159 domácností. Do konce roku 2018 budou realizovány další 3 vlny sběru dat s roční periodicitou. Pro komunikaci s veřejností je pro výzkum využíván název Proměny české společnosti http://www.promenyceskespolecnosti.cz Cílem výzkumu je zmapovat životní podmínky českých domácností z dlouhodobé perspektivy, charakterizovat proces změny v životě domácností a jednotlivců a vztáhnout proces sociální změny ke vztahům a dění v domácnostech. CHPS je mezioborový výzkum využívající přístupy sociologie, ekonomie a politologie. Zahrnuje pět hlavních tematických okruhů - rodinný život, užívání času, zdraví, vzdělání a trh práce, sociální stratifikace, bydlení, politická participace a občanská společnost. Výzkum organizuje Sociologický ústav Akademie věd ČR, v.v.i., CERGE-EI (společné pracoviště Centra pro ekonomický výzkum a doktorské studium Univerzity Karlovy a Národohospodářského ústavu Akademie věd ČR) a Fakulta sociálních studií Masarykovy univerzity. Výzkumný tým složený ze členů těchto institucí vytvořil metodický plán výzkumu a dotazové instrumenty, vybral ve veřejné soutěži realizátory terénních prací, s realizátory terénních prací spolupracuje na kontrole a čištění dat, zpracovává konečné datové soubory a zajišťuje jejich uložení v Českém sociálně vědním datovém archivu Sociologického ústavu AV ČR, v.v.i. Sběr dat realizují agentury MEDIAN, s.r.o., a STEM/MARK, a.s., které patří k nejvýznamnějším agenturám pro výzkum trhu a veřejného mínění v České republice. Jsou zakládající členové organizace SIMAR (Sdružení agentur pro výzkum trhu a veřejného mínění) a členové ESOMAR (European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research). Mimo sběr dat provedli realizátoři výběr vzorku, spolupracují na kontrole a čištění dat a poskytují konzultace k metodice výzkumu. Výzkum finančně podpořila Grantová agentura ČR z grantu GB14-36154G (Dynamika změny v české společnosti).\n          published_at publicationStatuses                 affiliation\n1

Afar, it offered\\na pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless\\nrain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.\\n\\nI returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little\\nfor, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could\\nnot pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of “the solitary\\nrocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from\\nits southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—\\n\\n“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\\nBoils round the naked, melancholy isles\\n\"\n[2] \"Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\\nPours in among the stormy Hebrides.”\\n\\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen,\\nNova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn\\nregions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the\\naccumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole,\\nand concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an\\nidea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through\\nchildren’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected\\nthemselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in\\na sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly\\nmoon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\\n\\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone;\\nits gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent,\\nattesting the hour of eventide.\\n\\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.\\n\\nThe fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of\\nterror.\\n\\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a\\ngallows.\\n\\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect\\nfeelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on\\nwinter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-\\ntable to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace\\nfrills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and\\nadventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from\\nthe pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.\\n\\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but\\ninterruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.\\n\\n“Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room\\napparently empty.\\n\\n“Where the dickens is she!” he continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not\\nhere: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!”\\n\\n“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-\\nplace: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or\\nconception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once—\\n\" \n```", "```py\njane_eyre <- tibble(\n raw_text = third_example,\n page_number = c(1:2)\n)\n```", "```py\njane_eyre <-\n separate_rows(jane_eyre, raw_text, sep = \"\\\\n\", convert = FALSE)\n\njane_eyre\n```", "```py\n# A tibble: 93 × 2\n   raw_text                                                          page_number\n   <chr>                                                                   <int>\n 1 \"CHAPTER I\"                                                                 1\n 2 \"There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.

We had\nbeen wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in\nthe morning; but since dinner (Mrs Reed, when there was no com-\npany, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds\nso sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise\n\nwas now out of the question.\n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\nafternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twi-\nlight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the\nchidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of\nmy physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round\ntheir mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the\nfireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quar-\nrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed\nfrom joining the group; saying, ‘She regretted to be under the\nnecessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from\nBessie, and could discover by her own observation that I was\nendeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and\nchild-like disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—\nsomething lighter, franker, more natural as it were—she really\nmust exclude me from privileges intended only for contented,\nhappy, littie children.’\n\n‘What does Bessie say I have done?’ I asked.\n\n‘Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners: besides, there is\nsomething truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that\nmanner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly,\nremain silent.’\n\n. a TV\n\ni; STA AEE LT JEUNE TIS Sis\na) | | | a) ee\ni Ni 4 | | | ae ST | | a eg\n\nce A FEM yi | eS ee\nPe TT (SB ag ie pe\nis \\ ie mu) i i es SS\nveal | Dy eT |\npa || i er itl |\n\naes : Oty ZR UIE OR HMR Sa ote ariel\nSEEN ed — =\n15\n```", "```py\n# Based on Tyler Bradley and Monica Alexander\nrepos <- gh(\"/users/RohanAlexander/repos\", per_page = 100)\nrepo_info <- tibble(\n name = map_chr(repos, \"name\"),\n created = map_chr(repos, \"created_at\"),\n full_name = map_chr(repos, \"full_name\"),\n)\n```", "```py\nmy_indicator <- 68\nmy_location <- 50\nmy_startyr <- 1996\nmy_endyr <- 1999\n\nurl <- paste0(\n \"https://population.un.org/dataportalapi/api/v1\",\n \"/data/indicators/\", my_indicator, \"/locations/\",\n my_location, \"/start/\", my_startyr, \"/end/\",\n my_endyr, \"/?format=csv\"\n)\n\nun_data <- read_delim(file = url, delim = \"|\", skip = 1)\n\nun_data |>\n filter(AgeLabel == 25 & TimeLabel == 1996) |>\n select(Value)\n```", "```py\nfifth_harmony |>\n filter(album_name %in% c(\"Reflection\", \"7/27 (Deluxe)\", \"Fifth Harmony\")) |> \n mutate(album_release_date = ymd(album_release_date)) |>\n filter(album_release_date != \"2017-10-29\") # There is a essentially duplicate album\n```"]
