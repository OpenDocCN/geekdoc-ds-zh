    we introduced various representations for solid objects. Rather than starting
    from classical continuum equations, we directly formulated elasticity simulations
    as discrete algebraic problems, with previous discussions primarily focusing on
    mesh-based purely Lagrangian schemes.

    scheme particularly suited for simulating large deformation and topology changes.
    Unlike purely Lagrangian methods such as [FEM](./lec19-linear_FEM.html), which
    track material deformation through the **elements** of a carefully constructed
    mesh structure, MPM discretizes the material simply into a set of [**material
    particles**](./lec26.1-material_particles.html). Each particle stores essential
    physical information such as mass, momentum, deformation gradient, and stress.
    MPM then utilizes a temporary, regular Cartesian background grid to solve the
    momentum equation, with information [transfered](./lec26.3-euler_lag_transfers.html)
    between particles and grid nodes.

    transferred onto the Eulerian grid, where governing equations are solved efficiently.
    Updated grid solutions are then transferred back onto the particles, [updating
    particle states](./lec26.4-particle_state_update.html) such as position and deformation
    gradient. After this transfer, the grid is reset, leaving particles as the sole
    carriers of material history. This hybrid strategy naturally accommodates significant
    deformation and complex contact scenarios, effectively overcoming typical mesh-distortion
    challenges inherent to traditional mesh-based purely Lagrangian methods.
