I was an okay programmer, especially for a highschooler, but I had never really wondered how much time it took for my code to execute before. But suddenly it started to matter: each problem now has a strict time limit. I started counting my operations. How many can you do in one second?</p><p>I didn’t know much about computer architecture to answer this question. But I also didn’t need the right answer — I needed a rule of thumb. My thought process was: “2-3GHz means 2 to 3 billion instructions executed every second, and in a simple loop that does something with array elements, I also need to increment loop counter, check end-of-loop condition, do array indexing and stuff like that, so let’s add room for 3-5 more instructions for every useful one” and ended up with using $5 \cdot 10^8$ as an estimate. None of these statements are true, but counting how many operations my algorithm needed and dividing it by this number was a good rule of thumb for my use case.</p><p>The real answer, of course, is much more complicated and highly dependent on what kind of “operation” you have in mind. It can be as low as $10^7$ for things like <a href="/hpc/cpu-cache/latency">pointer chasing</a> and as high as $10^{11}$ for <a href="/hpc/simd">SIMD-accelerated</a> linear algebra. To demonstrate these striking differences, we will use the case study of matrix multiplication implemented in different languages — and dig deeper into how computers execute them.</p><span class="anchor" id="types-of-languages"/><h2><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/complexity/languages/#types-of-languages">#</a>Types of Languages</h2><p>On the lowest level, computers execute <em>machine code</em> consisting of binary-encoded <em>instructions</em> which are used to control the CPU. They are specific, quirky, and require a great deal of intellectual effort to work with, so one of the first things people did after creating computers was create <em>programming languages</em>, which abstract away some details of how computers operate to simplify the process of programming.</p><p>A programming language is fundamentally just an interface. Any program written in it is just a nicer higher-level representation which still at some point needs to be transformed into the machine code to be executed on the CPU — and there are several different means of doing that:</p><ul><li>From a programmer’s perspective, there are two types of languages: <em>compiled</em>, which pre-process before executing, and <em>interpreted</em>, which are executed during runtime using a separate program called <em>an interpreter</em>.</li><li>From a computer’s perspective, there are also two types of languages: <em>native</em>, which directly execute machine code, and <em>managed</em>, which rely on some sort of <em>runtime</em> to do it.</li></ul><p>Since running machine code in an interpreter doesn’t make sense, this makes a total of three types of languages:</p><ul><li>Interpreted languages, such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby.</li><li>Compiled languages with a runtime, such as Java, C#, or Erlang (and languages that work on their VMs, such as Scala, F#, or Elixir).</li><li>Compiled native languages, such as C, Go, or Rust.</li></ul><p>There is no “right” way of executing computer programs: each approach has its own gains and drawbacks. Interpreters and virtual machines provide flexibility and enable some nice high-level programming features such as dynamic typing, run time code alteration, and automatic memory management, but these come with some unavoidable performance trade-offs, which we will now talk about.</p><span class="anchor" id="interpreted-languages"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/complexity/languages/#interpreted-languages">#</a>Interpreted languages</h3><p>Here is an example of a by-definition $1024 \times 1024$ matrix multiplication in pure Python:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code runs in 630 seconds. That’s more than 10 minutes!</p><p>Let’s try to put this number in perspective. The CPU that ran it has a clock frequency of 1.4GHz, meaning that it does $1.4 \cdot 10^9$ cycles per second, totaling to almost $10^{15}$ for the entire computation, and about 880 cycles per multiplication in the innermost loop.</p><p>This is not surprising if you consider the things that Python needs to do to figure out what the programmer meant:</p><ul><li>it parses the expression <code>c[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]</code>;</li><li>tries to figure out what <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are and looks up their names in a special hash table with type information;</li><li>understands that <code>a</code> is a list, fetches its <code>[]</code> operator, retrieves the pointer for <code>a[i]</code>, figures out it’s also a list, fetches its <code>[]</code> operator again, gets the pointer for <code>a[i][k]</code>, and then the element itself;</li><li>looks up its type, figures out that it’s a <code>float</code>, and fetches the method implementing <code>*</code> operator;</li><li>does the same things for <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and finally add-assigns the result to <code>c[i][j]</code>.</li></ul><p>Granted, the interpreters of widely used languages such as Python are well-optimized, and they can skip through some of these steps on repeated execution of the same code. But still, some quite significant overhead is unavoidable due to the language design. If we get rid of all this type checking and pointer chasing, perhaps we can get cycles per multiplication ratio closer to 1, or whatever the “cost” of native multiplication is?</p><span class="anchor" id="managed-languages"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/complexity/languages/#managed-languages">#</a>Managed Languages</h3><p>The same matrix multiplication procedure, but implemented in Java:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">java.util.Random</span><span class="o">;</span>

For now, we are not ready to tell you exactly how this is achieved. Implementations of dense matrix multiplication in OpenBLAS are typically <a href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/kernel/x86_64/dgemm_kernel_16x2_haswell.S">5000 lines of handwritten assembly</a> tailored separately for <em>each</em> architecture.

Thinking this way and <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html">comparing languages</a> in terms of performance doesn’t make much sense: programming languages are fundamentally just tools that take away <em>some</em> control over performance in exchange for convenient abstractions. Regardless of the execution environment, it is still largely a programmer’s job to use the opportunities that the hardware provides.</p></article><div class="nextprev"><div class="left"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/complexity/hardware/" id="prev-article">← Modern Hardware</a></div><div class="right"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/" id="next-article">../Computer Architecture →</a></div></div>
