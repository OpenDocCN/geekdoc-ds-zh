</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It calculates the sum of a 32-bit integer array, just as a simple <code>for</code> loop would.</p><p>The “body” of the loop is <code>add edx, DWORD PTR [rax]</code>: this instruction loads data from the iterator <code>rax</code> and adds it to the accumulator <code>edx</code>. Next, we move the iterator 4 bytes forward with <code>add rax, 4</code>. Then, a slightly more complicated thing happens.</p><span class="anchor" id="jumps"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/loops/#jumps">#</a>Jumps</h3><p>Assembly doesn’t have if-s, for-s, functions, or other control flow structures that high-level languages have. What it does have is <code>goto</code>, or “jump,” how it is known in the world of low-level programming.</p><p><strong>Jump</strong> moves the instruction pointer to a location specified by its operand. This location may be either an absolute address in memory, relative to the current address or even <a href="../indirect">computed during runtime</a>. To avoid the headache of managing these addresses directly, you can mark any instruction with a string followed by <code>:</code>, and then use this string as a label which gets replaced by the relative address of this instruction when converted to machine code.</p><p>Labels can be any string, but compilers don’t get creative and <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/T45x8GKa5">typically</a> just use the line numbers in the source code and function names with their signatures when picking names for labels.</p><p><strong>Unconditional</strong> jump <code>jmp</code> can only be used to implement <code>while (true)</code> kind of loops or stitch parts of a program together. A family of <strong>conditional</strong> jumps is used to implement actual control flow.</p><p>It is reasonable to think that these conditions are computed as <code>bool</code>-s somewhere and passed to conditional jumps as operands: after all, this is how it works in programming languages. But that is not how it is implemented in hardware. Conditional operations use a special <code>FLAGS</code> register, which first needs to be populated by executing instructions that perform some kind of check.</p><p>In our example, <code>cmp rax, rcx</code> compares the iterator <code>rax</code> with the end-of-array pointer <code>rcx</code>. This updates the <code>FLAGS</code> register, and now it can be used by <code>jne loop</code>, which looks up a certain bit there that tells whether the two values are equal or not, and then either jumps back to the beginning or continues to the next instruction, thus breaking the loop.</p><span class="anchor" id="loop-unrolling"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/loops/#loop-unrolling">#</a>Loop Unrolling</h3><p>One thing you might have noticed about the loop above is that there is a lot of overhead to process a single element. During each cycle, there is only one useful instruction executed, and the other 3 are incrementing the iterator and trying to find out if we are done yet.</p><p>What we can do is to <em>unroll</em> the loop by grouping iterations together — equivalent to writing something like this in C:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In assembly, it would look something like this:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nl">loop:</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now we only need 3 loop control instructions for 4 useful ones (an improvement from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{4}{7}$ in terms of efficiency), and this can be continued to reduce the overhead almost to zero.</p><p>In practice, unrolling loops isn’t always necessary for performance because modern processors don’t actually execute instructions one-by-one, but maintain a <a href="/hpc/pipelining">queue of pending instructions</a> so that two independent operations can be executed concurrently without waiting for each other to finish.</p><p>This is our case too: the real speedup from unrolling won’t be fourfold, because the operations of incrementing the counter and checking if we are done are independent from the loop body, and can be scheduled to run concurrently with it. But may still be beneficial to <a href="/hpc/compilation/situational">ask the compiler</a> to unroll it to some extent.</p><span class="anchor" id="an-alternative-approach"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/loops/#an-alternative-approach">#</a>An Alternative Approach</h3><p>You don’t have to explicitly use <code>cmp</code> or a similar instruction to make a conditional jump. Many other instructions either read or modify the <code>FLAGS</code> register, sometimes as a by-product enabling optional exception checks.</p><p>For example, <code>add</code> always sets a number of flags, denoting whether the result is zero, is negative, whether an overflow or an underflow occurred, and so on. Taking advantage of this mechanism, compilers often produce loops like this:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nasm" data-lang="nasm"><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nf">mov</span>  <span class="nb">rax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">100</span>  <span class="c1">; replace 100 with the array size</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code is a bit harder to read for a human, but it is one instruction shorter in the repeated part, which may meaningfully affect performance.</p></article><div class="nextprev"><div class="left"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/assembly/" id="prev-article">← Assembly Language</a></div><div class="right"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/functions/" id="next-article">Functions and Recursion →</a></div></div>
