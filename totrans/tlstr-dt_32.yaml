    science, and we have proposed one view of what it could look like. This revolution
    builds on the long history of statistics, borrows heavily from computer science,
    and draws on other disciplines as needed, but is centered around reproducibility,
    workflows, and respect. When data science began it was nebulous and ill-defined.

    data science. We now revisit it. We consider data science to be the process of
    developing and applying a principled, tested, reproducible, end-to-end workflow
    that focuses on quantitative measures in and of themselves, and as a foundation
    to explore questions. We have known for a long-time what rigor looks like in mathematical
    and statistical theory: theorems are accompanied by proofs ([Horton et al. 2022](99-references.html#ref-Horton2022)).
    And we increasingly know what rigor looks like in data science: claims that are
    accompanied by verified, tested, reproducible, code and data. Rigorous data science
    creates lasting understanding of the world.'

    are not the type of issues with a definitive answer. Instead, they are questions
    to be explored and played with. This work will move data science forward and,
    more importantly, help us tell better stories about the world. Here we detail
    some of them.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computer science has built a thorough foundation around testing and the importance
    of unit and functional tests is broadly accepted. One of the innovations of this
    book has been to integrate testing throughout the data science workflow, but this,
    like the first iteration of anything, needs considerable improvement and development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to thoroughly integrate testing through data science. But it is unclear
    what this should look like, how we should do it, and what is the end-state. What
    does it mean to have well-tested code in data science? Code coverage, which is
    a measure of the percentage of lines of code that have tests, is not especially
    meaningful in data science, but what should we use instead? What do tests look
    like in data science? How are they written? The extensive use of simulation in
    statistics, which data science has adopted, provides groundwork, but there is
    a significant amount of work and investment that is needed.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do not have a good understanding how much data cleaning and preparation is
    driving estimates. Huntington-Klein et al. ([2021](99-references.html#ref-huntington2021influence)),
    and Breznau et al. ([2022](99-references.html#ref-breznau2022observing)), among
    others, have begun this work. They show that hidden research decisions have a
    big effect on subsequent estimates, sometimes greater than the standard errors.
    Statistics provides a good understanding of how modeling affects estimates, but
    we need more investigation of the influence of the earlier stages of the data
    science workflow. More specifically, we need to look for key points of failure
    and understand the ways in which failure can happen.

- en: This is especially concerning as we scale to larger datasets. For instance,
    ImageNet is a dataset of 14 million images, which were hand-annotated. The cost,
    in both time and money, makes it prohibitively difficult to go through every image
    to ensure the label is consistent with the needs of each user of the dataset.
    Yet without undertaking this it is difficult to have much faith in subsequent
    model forecasts, especially in non-obvious cases.

    is the formal systematic approach to names, established by Carolus Linnaeus, the
    eighteenth century physician ([Morange 2016, 81](99-references.html#ref-morange)).
    Each species is referred to by two words with Latin grammatical form: the first
    is its genus, and the second is an adjective to characterize the species. Ensuring
    standardized nomenclature is given active consideration in biology. For instance,
    the use of nomenclature committees by researchers is recommended ([McCarthy et
    al. 2023](99-references.html#ref-McCarthy2023)). As discussed in [Chapter 9](09-clean_and_prepare.html),
    names are a large source of friction in data science, and a standardized approach
    is similarly needed in data science.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason this is so pressing is that it affects understanding, which impacts
    efficiency. The binomial nomenclature provides diagnostic information, not just
    a casual reference ([Koerner 2000, 45](99-references.html#ref-carolusbook)). This
    is particularly the case when data science is conducted in a team, rather than
    just one individual. A thorough understanding of what makes an effective name
    and then infrastructure to encourage them would bring significant dividends.

    parts?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have described the origins of data science as being various disciplines.
    Moving forward we need to consider what role these constituent parts, especially
    statistics and computer science, should play. More generally, we also need to
    establish how data science relates to, and interacts with, econometrics, applied
    mathematics, and computational social science. These draw on data science to answer
    questions in their own discipline, but like statistics and computer science, they
    also contribute back to data science. For instance, applications of machine learning
    in computational social science need to focus on transparency, interpretability,
    uncertainty, and ethics, and this all advances the more theoretical machine learning
    research done in other disciplines ([Wallach 2018](99-references.html#ref-Wallach2018)).

    science from computer scientists, etc. An example of the danger of not doing this
    is clear in the case of p-values, which we have not made much of in this book,
    but which dominate quantitative analysis even though statisticians have warned
    about their misapplication for decades. One issue with not learning statistics
    from statisticians is that statistical practice can become a recipe that is naively
    followed, because that is the easiest way to teach it, even though that is not
    how statisticians do statistics.
  prefs: []

    to ensure that data science has the best aspects, without also bringing bad practice,
    is an especially significant challenge. And this is not just technical, but also
    cultural ([Meng 2021](99-references.html#ref-Meng2021What)). It is particularly
    important to ensure that data science maintains an inclusive culture of excellence.

    are. It involves developing comfort with: computational thinking, sampling, statistics,
    graphs, Git and GitHub, SQL, command line, cleaning messy data, a few languages
    including R and Python, ethics, and writing. But we have very little agreement
    on how best to teach it. Partly this is because data science instructors often
    come from different fields, but it is also partly a difference in resources and
    priorities.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Complicating matters is that given the demand for data science skills we cannot
    limit data science education to graduate students because undergraduate students
    need those skills when they enter the workforce. If data science is to be taught
    at the undergraduate level, then it needs to be robust enough to be taught in
    large classes. Developing teaching tools that scale is critical. For instance,
    GitHub Actions could be used to run checks of student code and suggest improvements
    without instructor involvement. However, it is especially difficult to scale case
    studies style classes, which students often find so useful. Substantial innovation
    is needed.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Considerable innovation in data science occurs in industry, but sometimes this
    knowledge cannot be shared, and when it can it tends to be done slowly. The term
    data science has been used in academia since the 1960s, but it is because of industry
    that it has become popular in the past decade or so ([Irizarry 2020](99-references.html#ref-Irizarry2020Role)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bringing academia and industry together is both a key challenge for data science
    and one of the easiest to overlook. The nature of the problems faced in industry,
    for instance scoping the needs of a client, and operating at scale, are removed
    from typical academic concerns. There is a danger that academic research could
    be rendered moot unless academics establish and maintain one foot in industry,
    and enable industry to actively participate in academia. From the industry side,
    ensuring that best practice is quickly adopted can be challenging if there is
    no immediate payoff. Ensuring that industry experience is valued in academic hiring
    and grant evaluation would help, as would encouraging entrepreneurship in academia.
