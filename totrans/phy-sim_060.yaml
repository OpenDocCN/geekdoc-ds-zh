- en: To address the inversion artifact observed in our case study of compressing
    mass-spring elastic squares, the application of barrier-type elasticity energies
    is essential. Our penalty method for moving BCs plays a crucial role when these
    energies are applied, as directly prescribing BC nodes can still lead to inversion.
    In the next chapter, we will explore hyperelasticity models, which are preferred
    over mass-spring systems in practical applications.
