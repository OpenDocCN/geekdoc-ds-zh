    With roughly three-orders-of-magnitude difference in speed between the fastest
    on-chip register memory and mapped host memory that must traverse the PCIe bus,
    literate CUDA developers must understand the most efficient ways to use memory.
    Latency hiding through ILP or TLP is essential to application performance. Prefetching
    can keep more memory transactions in flight to move data to fast memory and speed
    even memory bandwidth-limited reduction operations. Irregular data structures
    are a challenge with current GPU technology, but some techniques can preserve
    performance even with random memory accesses. However, finding more and better
    ways to utilize GPU memory is an area of active research as new libraries become
    available that support irregular data structures such as graphs and sparse matrices.At
    the end of this chapter, the reader will have a basic understanding of:■ Using
    prefetch to better utilize global memory.■ Efficient use of registers, shared,
    and global memory in an ILP-based reduction kernel.■ How to write generic methods
    that utilize functors.■ Techniques to speed problems that have irregular and random
    memory accesses.■ Generic approaches and libraries for sparse matrices.■ Graph
    centrality metrics and codes that can provide 10- to 50-times speedups.■ Performance

- en: Reduction operations perform common tasks such as finding the minimum, maximum,
    or sum of a vector. Writing a high-performance reduction for GPU computing is
    surprisingly complex because it requires a detailed understanding of CUDA memory
    spaces and the execution model.The thrust API provides a simple interface that
    hides all the complexity of a reduction, making it both flexible and easy to use.
    Thrust uses a reduction designed by Mark Harris at NVIDIA. The paper and example
    code demonstrating various optimizations for reduction are included with the NVIDIA
    SDK in the *reduction* directory. Both the paper and code are recommended reading.This
    chapter provides a reduction example that ties together much of the discussion
    in previous chapters and extends the reduction created by Mark Harris:■ C++ templates
    extend the generality of the reduction code to use user-defined types such as
    floats, doubles, integers, long integers, and others.■ New features of compute
    2.0 devices such as the PTX prefetch instruction and inline assembly code are
    used to increase global memory read performance.■ Temporary storage is passed
    to the reduction method so that the programmer can eliminate redundant **cudaMalloc()**
    and **cudaFree()** operations that slow the thrust implementation as noted in
    [Chapter 3](B9780123884268000033.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00003-3).■ The passing
    and use of inline functors is demonstrated to create a generic reduction operation
    that is applicable more than just finding the sum of a vector.■ ILP, discussed
    in [Chapter 4](B9780123884268000045.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00004-5), is utilized
    both to make the code more understandable and to free SM resources for complicated
    reductions such as the objective functions defined in [Chapter 3](B9780123884268000033.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00003-3)
    and [Chapter 4](B9780123884268000045.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00004-5).

    API提供了一个简单的接口，隐藏了所有降低操作的复杂性，使其既灵活又易于使用。Thrust使用了NVIDIA的Mark Harris设计的降低方法。展示各种降低优化的论文和示例代码已包含在NVIDIA
    SDK的*reduction*目录中。论文和代码都是推荐阅读的内容。本章提供了一个降低操作的示例，结合了前几章的讨论，并扩展了Mark Harris创建的降低方法：■

- en: 'The following walkthrough of the code for the generic reduction template *functionReduce.h*
    covers the key concepts and thinking behind each section of code. The code snippets
    can be combined to construct the complete *functionReduce.h* source file.The **#ifndef**
    check of the preprocessor variable **REDUCE_H** protects against compiler errors,
    should the template file ever be included multiple times; see [Example 6.1](#tb0010),
    “Part 1 of *functionReduce.h*”:`#ifndef REDUCE_H``#define REDUCE_H`For simplicity,
    the following section of the template defines the number of blocks and threads
    for use on a C2050 or C2070 GPU. These definitions can be set manually from the
    information determined by the NVIDIA SDK code **deviceQuery**. A production version
    of this template might query the device properties and set these values automatically,
    as in [Example 6.2](#tb0015), “Part 2 of *functionReduce.h*”:`// Define the number
    of blocks as a multiple of the number of SM``// and the number of threads as the
    maximum resident on the SM``#define N_BLOCKS (1*14)``#define N_THREADS 1024``#define
    WARP_SIZE 32`[Example 6.3](#tb0020) starts the definition of the **_functionReduce()**
    method:`template <class T, typename UnaryFunction, typename BinaryFunction>``__global__
    void``_functionReduce(T *g_odata, unsigned int n, T initVal, UnaryFunction fcn,
    BinaryFunction fcn1)``{`Notice that:■ All variables are defined in terms of the
    template variable type **T** for generality. For example, **T** can be defined
    as a **float**, **double**, **int**, or **char** type.■ A scratch region of memory
    is provided so that each SM can write a single partial result of type **T** to
    global memory. Passing a pointer allows reuse of the scratch space to avoid the
    repetitive allocate and free overhead observed in the thrust reduction operation
    in [Chapter 3](B9780123884268000033.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00003-3).■ The number
    of calls to the unary function **fcn()** is passed to via the variable **n**.■
    The unary function **fcn()** can be defined to fetch data from memory or calculate
    some result on the fly. For example, the test code that follows this template
    defines **fcn()** as a functor that fetches data from a vector in global memory.
    Alternative functors can fetch data from complex data structures in global memory,
    calculate a result based on numerous data structures in memory, perform a table
    lookup, or avoid the use of global memory entirely by returning some constant
    or computed value.■ As with the thrust reduction call, an initial value is passed.
    This can be the starting value for a sum, or an initial value to use in a **minimum()**
    or **maximum()** reduction.■ The binary function **fcn1()** defines a generic
    operation on two of the values returned by **fcn()**. Examples include the **thrust::plus()**
    functor when a sum is desired. Similarly, the **thrust::minimum()** or **thrust::maximum()**
    functors can be used. Alternatively, the user can provide his or her own binary
    functor.Each thread on the GPU starts out with the register variable **myVal**
    set to **initVal**. Then each thread iterates through and calculates a partial
    result in fast register memory. If **fcn1()** were a **plus()** operation and
    **fcn()** fetched data from a vector in global memory, then **myVal** would contain
    the partial sums of all the vector elements as shown in [Figure 6.1](#f0010).
    This step reduces the data from **n** values (which could be on the order of millions)
    to **N_BLOCKS*N_THREADS** partial values. Note that the loop traverses the vector
    in reverse order, starting at the end and working toward the beginning. This approach
    gives the author of **fcn()** the opportunity to confirm that any prefetching
    does not access data prior to the start of the vector. Thus **fcn()** does not
    need to know the end or length of the vector, which saves memory and a register.

    >= 0; i -= gridSize)``myVal = fcn1(fcn(i), myVal);``}`After this loop completes,
    the register variable **myVal** contains **N_BLOCKS*N_THREADS** partial values.
    In CUDA, register variables are not accessible to other threads. For this reason,
    it is necessary to move the partial values stored in **myVal** to slower shared
    memory so that they can be accessed by other threads. The transfer from register
    to shared memory happens in step 2 shown in [Example 6.5](#tb0030). This is a
    parallel transfer all the threads in each thread block to the shared memory variable
    **smem** inside each SM.Shared memory is a valuable resource, so only the minimum
    amount is allocated. Based on the discussion of ILP in [Chapter 4](B9780123884268000045.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00004-5),
    the parallelism of only one warp of threads is used to perform the reduction from
    **N_THREADS** partial values on each SM to **WARP_SIZE** partial values. The register
    variable **myVal** already contains the correct values for the first warp. Thus,
    the shared memory **smem** variable needs only contain the contents of the **myVal**
    register variables in threads with a **threadIdx.x** greater than or equal to
    **WARP_SIZE**. As a result, **smem** can be allocated to contain **WARP_SIZE**
    fewer elements than **N_THREADS**.Because the transfer from register to shared
    memory occurs in parallel, the CUDA **__syncthreads()** method must be called
    after the assignment to ensure that all the elements of **smem** have been written.
    All of this happens in the few lines of [Example 6.5](#tb0030), “Part 5 of *functionReduce.h*”:`//
    2) Use the second fastest memory (shared memory) in a warp``// synchronous fashion.``//
    Create shared memory for per-block reduction.``// Reuse the registers in the first
    warp.``volatile __shared__ T smem[N_THREADS-WARP_SIZE];``// put all the register
    values into a shared memory``if(threadIdx.x >= WARP_SIZE) smem[threadIdx.x - WARP_SIZE]
    = myVal;``__syncthreads(); // wait for all threads in the block to complete.`At
    this point in the kernel, there is no reason to use more than the number of threads
    in one warp because the SM can issue only a single instruction per warp. Because
    there are no unresolved data dependencies, a single warp is sufficient to keep
    the SM busy in reducing the contents of shared memory from (**N_THREADS – WARP_SIZE)**
    elements to **WARP_SIZE** partial values on each SM. [¹](#fn0010) That is why
    a conditional is used to keep only threads with a **threadIdx.x** less than **WARP_SIZE**
    active. See [Example 6.6](#tb0035), “Part 6 of *functionReduce.h*”:¹Depending
    on the compute generation, the SM might be able to issue instructions on the half-warp.`if(threadIdx.x
    < WARP_SIZE) {``// now using just one warp. The SM can only run one warp at a
    time``#pragma unroll``for(int i=threadIdx.x; i < (N_THREADS − WARP_SIZE); i +=
    WARP_SIZE)``myVal = fcn1(myVal,(T)smem[i]);``smem[threadIdx.x] = myVal; // save
    myVal in this warp to the start of smem``}`What remains is to reduce the values
    in one warp to a single value on each SM. This equates to **N_BLOCKS** partial
    values, as **N_BLOCKS** was defined to use one block per SM. It is worth noting
    that the parallelism within the warp at this point does not contribute much to
    the performance, as only five calls to **fcn1()** are made in [Example 6.7](#tb0040).An
    alternative implementation can use a simple loop over **WARP_SIZE** running on
    a single thread (e.g., when **threadIdx.x** == 0) to create the single partial
    value per SM. If **fcn1()** were the **plus**() functor, this serial version would
    perform only 27 extra additions that would consume only a trivial amount of extra
    time—on the order of 100 nanoseconds. Thus, it is sometimes unnecessary to exploit
    all the parallelism in a system. Still, the parallel code was simple, and it might
    benefit us in a future compute generation, so we use the implementation in [Example
    6.7](#tb0040), “Part 7 of *functionReduce.h*”:`// reduce shared memory.``if (threadIdx.x
    < 16)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x + 16]);``if
    (threadIdx.x < 8)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x
    + 8]);``if (threadIdx.x < 4)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x
    + 4]);``if (threadIdx.x < 2)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x
    + 2]);``if (threadIdx.x < 1)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x
    + 1]);`The final task requires reducing the remaining **N_BLOCKS** partial values
    into a single value that completes the reduction. At this point, the code can
    either:■ Transfer the **N_BLOCKS**, (14 for this example), partial values to the
    host, where the final reduction will occur.■ Utilize atomic operations as described
    in section B.5 of the *NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide* to ensure that all the
    partial values are written to global memory before completing the reduction.Because
    both implementations require the allocation of scratch space for the **N_BLOCKS**
    partial values, [Example 6.8](#tb0045), “Part 8 of *functionReduce.h*,” performs
    the transfer to the host because it demonstrates the use of the **fcn1()** functor
    on both the host and device:`// 3) Use global memory as a last resort to transfer
    results to the host``// write result for each block to global mem``if (threadIdx.x
    == 0) g_odata[blockIdx.x] = smem[0];``// Can put the final reduction across SM
    here if desired.``}`The host method **partialReduce()** allocates the partial
    sums if needed and calls the CUDA kernel, as in [Example 6.9](#tb0050), “Part
    8 of *functionReduce.h*”:`template<typename T, typename UnaryFunction, typename
    BinaryFunction>``inline void partialReduce(const int n, T** d_partialVals, T initVal,
    UnaryFunction const& fcn, BinaryFunction const& fcn1)``{``if(*d_partialVals ==
    NULL)``cudaMalloc(d_partialVals, (N_BLOCKS+1) * sizeof(T));``_functionReduce<T><<<
    N_BLOCKS, N_THREADS>>>(*d_partialVals, n, initVal, fcn, fcn1);``}`As can be seen
    in [Example 6.10](#tb0055), “Part 9 of *functionReduce.h*,” the **N_BLOCK** partial
    values are transferred from the GPU to the host, where a host-based version of
    **fcn1()** is used to compete the reduction. An **#endif** completes the preprocessor
    **#ifdef** statement to protect against compiler errors, should the header file
    be included multiple times. See [Example 6.10](#tb0055), “Part 9 of *functionReduce.h*”:`template<typename
    T, typename UnaryFunction, typename BinaryFunction>``inline T functionReduce(const
    int n, T** d_partialVals, T initVal, UnaryFunction const& fcn, BinaryFunction

    << endl;``exit(1);``}``T val = h_partialVals[0];``for(int i=1; i < N_BLOCKS; i++)

    i = n-1 -(blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x);``i >= 0; i -= gridSize)``myVal
    = fcn1(fcn(i), myVal);``}`在这个循环完成后，寄存器变量**myVal**包含了**N_BLOCKS*N_THREADS**个部分值。在CUDA中，寄存器变量对其他线程不可访问。因此，有必要将存储在**myVal**中的部分值移动到较慢的共享内存中，以便其他线程能够访问。这一从寄存器到共享内存的转移发生在步骤2中，如[示例6.5](#tb0030)所示。这是一个并行转移，所有线程块中的线程将数据转移到每个SM内的共享内存变量**smem**中。共享内存是宝贵的资源，因此只分配最少量的共享内存。根据[第4章](B9780123884268000045.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00004-5)中对ILP的讨论，只有一个warp的线程并行性被用来将每个SM上的**N_THREADS**个部分值减少到**WARP_SIZE**个部分值。寄存器变量**myVal**已经包含了第一个warp的正确值。因此，**smem**共享内存变量只需要包含**myVal**寄存器变量中**threadIdx.x**大于或等于**WARP_SIZE**的线程的内容。结果，**smem**可以分配给**WARP_SIZE**比**N_THREADS**少的元素。由于从寄存器到共享内存的转移是并行的，必须在赋值后调用CUDA的**__syncthreads()**方法，以确保所有**smem**的元素都已经写入。[示例6.5](#tb0030)中的几行代码完成了这一操作，“*functionReduce.h*
    第5部分”：`// 2) 在warp中使用第二快的内存（共享内存）``// 按同步方式。``// 为每个块创建共享内存以进行归约。``// 重用第一个warp中的寄存器。``volatile
    __shared__ T smem[N_THREADS-WARP_SIZE];``// 将所有寄存器值放入共享内存``if(threadIdx.x >= WARP_SIZE)
    smem[threadIdx.x - WARP_SIZE] = myVal;``__syncthreads(); // 等待块中的所有线程完成.`此时，内核中没有理由使用超过一个warp线程数的线程，因为每个SM每次只能执行一个warp的指令。由于没有未解决的数据依赖性，单个warp足以保持SM忙于将共享内存中的内容从(**N_THREADS
    – WARP_SIZE)**个元素减少到每个SM上的**WARP_SIZE**个部分值。[¹](#fn0010)这就是为什么使用条件语句来保持**threadIdx.x**小于**WARP_SIZE**的线程处于活动状态。请参见[示例6.6](#tb0035)，“*functionReduce.h*
    第6部分”：¹根据计算代的不同，SM可能能够在半warp上发出指令。`if(threadIdx.x < WARP_SIZE) {``// 现在只使用一个warp。SM每次只能运行一个warp``#pragma
    unroll``for(int i=threadIdx.x; i < (N_THREADS − WARP_SIZE); i += WARP_SIZE)``myVal
    = fcn1(myVal,(T)smem[i]);``smem[threadIdx.x] = myVal; // 将myVal保存在此warp的smem开始位置``}`剩下的任务是将一个warp中的值归约成每个SM上的单一值。这等同于**N_BLOCKS**个部分值，因为**N_BLOCKS**定义为每个SM使用一个块。值得注意的是，此时warp内的并行性对性能的贡献不大，因为在[示例6.7](#tb0040)中只进行了五次**fcn1()**的调用。一种替代的实现方法是使用一个简单的循环，针对**WARP_SIZE**中的每个元素由单个线程（例如，当**threadIdx.x**
    == 0时）执行，以创建每个SM上的单一部分值。如果**fcn1()**是**plus**()功能函数，这种串行版本将仅执行27次额外的加法，所消耗的时间几乎可以忽略不计，大约100纳秒。因此，有时并不需要充分利用系统中的所有并行性。然而，尽管如此，使用简单的并行代码，未来的计算代中可能会有所获益，因此我们使用了[示例6.7](#tb0040)中的实现，“*functionReduce.h*
    第7部分”：`// 归约共享内存。``if (threadIdx.x < 16)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x
    + 16]);``if (threadIdx.x < 8)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x

    + 2]);``if (threadIdx.x < 1)``smem[threadIdx.x] = fcn1((T)smem[threadIdx.x],(T)smem[threadIdx.x
    + 1]);`最终任务是将剩余的**N_BLOCKS**个部分值归约成一个单一的值，完成归约。在这一点上，代码可以选择：■ 将**N_BLOCKS**（在此示例中为14）个部分值转移到主机，由主机完成最终的归约。■

  zh: 一个用于 functionReduce.h 的测试程序
- en: 'The test program for the *functionReduce.h* template creates a vector of sequential
    integers in memory similar to the examples in the first chapter. The size of the
    vector can be specified via the command line. The user can also provide a numerical
    option to run with a functor that utilizes the CUDA PTX **prefetch.global** assembly
    instruction, a functor that reads from memory (without any prefetching), and a
    **thrust::reduce()** call.The **fcn1()** method can be specified at compile time.
    By default, the application performs a sum. Other functors such as **thrust::minimum()**
    or **thrust::maximum()** can be used by changing the definition of **FCN1** either
    in the code or via the **nvcc** command. The type of the run can be changed by
    changing the preprocessor variable **RUNTYPE**. Specifying the preprocessor variable
    **DO_CHECK** performs a verification test against the thrust reduction code.[Example
    6.11](#tb0060), “Part 1 of *testPre.cu*,” is a walkthrough of the test code. If
    desired, the individual code snippets can be combined to create a complete working
    test. The necessary preprocessors and namespace definitions occur at the beginning
    of the file:`#include <iostream>``using namespace std;``#include <thrust/host_vector.h>``#include
    <thrust/device_vector.h>``#include <thrust/functional.h>``#include <thrust/random.h>``#include
    "functionReduce.h"``#ifndef RUNTYPE``#define RUNTYPE int``#endif``#ifndef FCN1``#define
    FCN1 plus``#endif``#include <iostream>``using namespace std;`The **prefetch**
    functor is a persistent functor that keeps a pointer to device memory. Each call
    to the functor returns the vector indexed by **i**. Prior to returning the vector
    element, the index is checked to see whether it is possible to prefetch the next
    grid of data values (e.g., **N_BLOCKS*N_THREADS** values) from global memory.The
    prefetch index can be tested for validity because **_functionReduce()** traverses
    the vector in reverse order. Testing that the index is greater than or equal to
    zero ensures that only valid elements in the array will be prefetched. If the
    index is valid, the PTX **prefetch.global.L2** assembly instruction is used to
    perform the prefetch. This instruction is valid only for compute 2.0 devices.
    See [Example 6.12](#tb0065), “Part 2 of *testPre.cu*”:`template<class T1, class
    T2>``struct prefetch : public thrust::unary_function<T1,T2> {``const T1* data;``prefetch(T1*
    _data) : data(_data) {};``__device__``// This method prefetchs the previous grid
    of data point into the L2.``T1 operator()(T2 i) {``if( (i-N_BLOCKS*N_THREADS)
    > 0) { //prefetch the previous grid``const T1 *pt = &data[i − (N_BLOCKS*N_THREADS)];``asm
    volatile ("prefetch.global.L2 [%0];"::"l"(pt) );``}``return data[i];``}``};`The
    **memFetch()** functor is similar to the **prefetch()** functor except that it
    does not perform any prefetching. This functor can run on all compute devices.
    See [Example 6.13](#tb0070), “Part 3 of *testPre.cu*”:`template<class T1, class
    T2>``struct memFetch : public thrust::unary_function<T1,T2> {``const T1* data;``memFetch(T1*
    _data) : data(_data) {};``__host__ __device__``T1 operator()(T2 i) {``return data[i];``}``};`This
    test utilizes a random sequence of zeros and ones based on the lowest bit of a
    random number. These numbers are created with the functor shown in the following
    code:`// a parallel random number generator``// http://groups.google.com/group/thrust-users/browse_thread/thread/dca23bfa678689a5``struct
    parallel_random_generator``{``__host__ __device__``unsigned int operator()(const
    unsigned int n) const``{``thrust::default_random_engine rng;``// discard n numbers
    to avoid correlation``rng.discard(n);``// return a random number``return rng()
    & 0x01;``}``};`The **doTest()** routine is straightforward C++. The pointer to
    the scratch space, **d_partialVals**, is set to NULL, which means that the first
    call to **functionReduce()** will allocate the needed space. The device vector
    **d_data** is allocated via the thrust API according the size passed to this method
    in the variable **nData**.The variable **op** selects the test that will be performed.
    A 0 specifies that no prefetching will be used; 1 selects the prefetching test.
    Any other value specifies that the thrust reduction method is called. See [Example

    per reduction, averaged over 100 runs, is reported. For smaller vector sizes,
    **functionReduce()** clearly outperforms the thrust implementation with a maximum
    8-times speedup. As noted in [Chapter 3](B9780123884268000033.xhtml#B978-0-12-388426-8.00003-3),
    much of this speedup can be attributed to the fact that the time to allocate scratch
    space occurs only once in the **functionReduce()** implementation. Care must be
    exercised when interpreting the timings of small runs because they finish very
    quickly. Even operating system daemon processes briefly waking up can affect performance,
    as noted in the paper “The Case of the Missing Supercomputer Performance” ([Petrini,

    is that it makes better use of the available global memory bandwidth. [Figure
    6.2](#f0015) is a comparison plot created with the visual profiler shows that
    the prefetch global memory read throughput (the top line) is 21.8 percent higher
    than the nonprefetch version of the code. The higher global memory read performance
    benefits larger vector problems, as the prefetch version is always faster than
    the nonprefetch version. Prefetching is also slightly faster than the thrust implementation,

    on GPUs. Most of these algorithms exhibit irregular and even random memory access
    patterns.Graph algorithms are common in social media analysis ([Corley, Farber,

    “gathers” data from arbitrary vector elements. See [Example 6.17](#tb0090), “A

    parallel computers because increasing memory bandwidth does not necessarily increase
    performance. Coalesced memory accesses imply that memory accesses can be grouped
    together into a single memory transaction that works on a number of consecutive
    bytes of information. [Table 5.10](B9780123884268000057.xhtml#t0055) and [Table
    5.11](B9780123884268000057.xhtml#t0060) show the coalesced memory efficiencies
    for various use cases with caching enabled and disabled on compute 2.0 GPUs.Irregular
    memory accesses break the assumption that memory transactions can be coalesced
    into one or a few large memory transactions. For example, the **index** vector
    in [Example 6.16](#tb0085) can contain random index values that will cause each
    thread accessing **b**[**index**[**i**]] to generate a separate global memory
    transaction. This is a worst-case scenario for the SM (along with the GPU memory
    subsystem), as each warp will have to wait for all 32 memory accesses to complete
    before the warp can issue an instruction. In the absolute worst case, all the
    warps and SM will issue memory transactions that fall on a single memory partition
    in global memory, which will decrease the available memory bandwidth to that of
    a single memory subsystem.The L2 cache in compute 2.0 and later devices provides
    the best single solution to accelerate algorithms that perform irregular memory
    accesses. Though not a general solution, the L2 cache will transparently speed
    most applications just because it provides a high-speed region of memory where
    the threads on each SM can request small, irregular memory accesses.Localizing
    memory accesses can make a tremendous difference in application performance because
    it allows the L2 cache to work more effectively on behalf of the application threads.
    Sorting the index array is a reasonable method to use for random data assuming
    some reordering of the indices is allowed. Of course, much better performance
    can be achieved when the programmer works to exploit the locality of reference
    within the algorithm.The following program, *testGather.cu*, implements [Example
    6.16](#tb0085) in a CUDA test code. The thrust API was used to conveniently transfer
    data to and from the host as well as fill and sort the index array. The first
    part of the program—[Example 6.19](#tb0100), “Part 1 of *testGather.cu*”—defines
    a gather functor:`#include <omp.h>``#include <iostream>``using namespace std;``#include
    <thrust/host_vector.h>``#include <thrust/device_vector.h>``#include <thrust/sort.h>``#include

    index(_index) {};``__host__ __device__``int operator()(int i) {``return data[index[i]];``}``};`[Example
    6.20](#tb0105), “Part 2 of *testGather.cu*,” parses the command-line arguments
    and performs the test:`int main(int argc, char *argv[])``{``if(argc < 3) {``cerr

    << "Success!" << endl;``cout << "Average time " << (endTime-startTime)/nLoops
    << endl;``}`This program requires the user specify:■ The size of the vector in
    millions of elements.■ The number of tests to perform in calculating the average
    runtime.■ An integer value that specifies what type of test *testGather.cu* should
    perform. The program understands the following values:■ A 0 value fills the index
    vector with sequential values. All memory accesses are sequential and coalesced.■
    A 1 specifies that **index** contains a sorted list of random index values. This
    option shows the performance that can be achieved by regularizing the index values
    to exploit any locality.■ The default is to fill **index** with random values.
    This is a worst-case scenario for the GPU memory system.Running *testGather.cu*
    on an NVIDIA C2070 GPU shows that the L2 cache does a remarkably good job when
    handling small problems. It can provide an order of magnitude of increased performance
    when the random accesses are localized by sorting. Of course, sorting is good
    only in the average case. Worst-case performance will not be any different from
    the random case. This test assumes that index will be reused, so the time to perform
    the sort was not included in the runtimes reported in [Table 6.2](#t0015).'

  zh: '前面的例子使用了非常规律的访问模式，这些模式从全局内存流式传输信息。大量计算问题，如图算法和树算法，代表了在GPU上合并并行内存访问的最坏情况。这些算法大多表现出不规律甚至是随机的内存访问模式。图算法在社交媒体分析中很常见（[Corley,
    Farber, & Reynolds, 2011](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref21)）以及生物学（Jones和Pavel，2004）和许多其他领域。树算法通常用于快速数据存储和检索。同样，向量的*gather*和*scatter*操作常用于稀疏矩阵和数值计算。向量gather操作“聚集”来自任意向量元素的数据。参见[示例6.17](#tb0090)，“向量Gather操作”：`for(int
    i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = b[index[i]];` 向量scatter操作是将数据“分散”到内存中的向量中的操作，参见[示例6.18](#tb0095)，“向量Scatter操作”：`for(int
    i = 0; i < n; i++) a[index[i]] = b[i];` 不规则的内存访问对大规模并行计算机是一个挑战，因为增加内存带宽并不一定会提高性能。合并内存访问意味着内存访问可以组合成一个单一的内存事务，作用于一组连续的字节信息。[表5.10](B9780123884268000057.xhtml#t0055)和[表5.11](B9780123884268000057.xhtml#t0060)显示了在启用和禁用缓存的情况下，计算2.0
    GPU上各种用例的合并内存效率。不规则的内存访问打破了内存事务可以合并为一个或几个大内存事务的假设。例如，[示例6.16](#tb0085)中的**index**向量可能包含随机的索引值，这将导致每个线程访问**b**[**index**[**i**]]时生成一个独立的全局内存事务。这对于SM（以及GPU内存子系统）来说是最坏的情况，因为每个warp必须等所有32个内存访问完成后才能发出指令。在最坏的情况下，所有warp和SM将发出内存事务，且这些事务落在全局内存的单一内存分区上，这会将可用的内存带宽降低到单一内存子系统的水平。计算2.0及更高版本的设备中的L2缓存提供了加速执行不规则内存访问算法的最佳单一解决方案。虽然这不是一种通用解决方案，但L2缓存会透明地加速大多数应用程序，因为它提供了一个高速内存区域，SM上的线程可以在此区域中请求小的、不规则的内存访问。局部化内存访问可以显著改善应用程序性能，因为它允许L2缓存更有效地为应用程序线程工作。对索引数组进行排序是处理随机数据的一个合理方法，前提是允许对索引进行某种重新排序。当然，当程序员努力利用算法中的引用局部性时，可以获得更好的性能。以下程序，*testGather.cu*，在CUDA测试代码中实现了[示例6.16](#tb0085)。使用了Thrust
    API，以方便地将数据从主机传输到设备，并填充和排序索引数组。程序的第一部分—[示例6.19](#tb0100)，“*testGather.cu*的第1部分”—定义了一个gather

    {``cout << "错误!" << endl; return(1);``}``}``cout << "成功!" << endl;``cout << "平均时间

    一个整数值，指定*testGather.cu*应执行的测试类型。该程序理解以下值：■ 0值将索引向量填充为顺序值。所有内存访问都是顺序的并且是合并的。■ 1指定**index**包含一个已排序的随机索引值列表。此选项显示通过规范化索引值以利用局部性所能实现的性能。■
    默认情况下，将**index**填充为随机值。这是GPU内存系统的最坏情况。 在NVIDIA C2070 GPU上运行*testGather.cu*表明，当处理小问题时，L2缓存表现得非常出色。当通过排序局部化随机访问时，它可以提供数量级的性能提升。当然，排序仅在平均情况下有效。最坏情况下的性能与随机情况没有任何不同。该测试假设索引会被重用，因此未将排序的时间包含在[表6.2](#t0015)中报告的运行时间内。'

    structure.Centrality in a graph is a measure of the relative importance of a vertex
    within the graph. Examples include: how important a person is within a social
    network and how critical a road is within a traffic network. The principle centrality
    metrics are as follows ([Corley, Farber, & Reynolds, 2011](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref21)):■
    Degree centrality: A metric of the connectedness of a node. It is simply a count
    of the number of edges that attach to a node. For a graph *G* with *n* vertices,
    edges *e* and vertices *v*, the degree centrality *C[D]*(*v*) for vertex *v* is:(6.1)![B9780123884268000069/si1.gif
    is missing](B9780123884268000069/si1.gif)■ Closeness centrality: A metric that
    counts the average distance of a node to all other nodes. Closeness can be productive
    in communicating information among the nodes or actors in a graph. It is defined
    in [Equation 6.2](#fm0015) as the average shortest path or geodesic distance from
    node *v* and all reachable nodes (*t* in *V*/*v*):(6.2)![B9780123884268000069/si2.gif
    is missing](B9780123884268000069/si2.gif)■ Betweenness centrality: A metric that
    measures how often paths between nodes must traverse a given node. Betweenness
    centrality ([Equation 6.3](#fm0020)) measures internode influence. In social media
    analysis, for example, an individual or blog is central if it lies between other
    individuals or blogs on their geodesics – the blog is “between” many others, where
    *g[jk]* is the number of geodesics linking blog *j* and blog *k* (Wasserman and
    Faust, 1994):(6.3)![B9780123884268000069/si3.gif is missing](B9780123884268000069/si3.gif)■
    Page rank: Page rank ([Example 6.4](#tb0025)) is an example of eigenvector centrality
    that measures the importance of a node by assuming links from more central nodes
    contribute more to its ranking than less central nodes (Brin & Page, 1998). Let
    *d* be a damping factor (usually 0.85), *n* be the index to the node of interest,
    *p[n]* be the node, *M*(*p[i]*) be the set of nodes linking to *p[n]* and *L*(*p[j]*)
    be the out-link counts on page *p[j]*:(6.4)![B9780123884268000069/si4.gif is missing](B9780123884268000069/si4.gif)Certain
    complex metrics (e.g., betweenness, eigenvector centrality) can become intractable
    when presented with large volumes of data unless appropriate machines and algorithms
    are utilized. Developers and users must understand the runtime performance, accuracy,
    and problem size trade-offs between exact and approximate centrality algorithms
    ([Ediger et al., 2010](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref37)).It is possible for a
    GPU to deliver an order of magnitude or more of increased performance on graph
    centrality metrics. The **gpu-fan** (GPU-based Fast Analysis of Networks) project
    at Vanderbilt provides a working software package that includes methods for computing
    four shortest path-based centrality metrics. This project reports that the GPU
    speeds up the application by 10 to 50 times on real-world protein interaction
    and gene co-expression networks as well as simulated scale-free networks ([Shi
    & Zhang, 2011](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref119)). The nascent thrust-graph library
    that is hosted on Google Code is attempting to create a common graph API and set
    of algorithms for CUDA-enabled GPUs.Programming graph algorithms on GPUs is in
    a particularly early stage of development. The paper “Exploring the Limits of
    GPUs with Parallel Graph Algorithms” ([Dehne & Yogaratnam, 2010](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref28))
    is a recent survey of the field. A more dated but still relevant paper is “Accelerating
    Large Graph Algorithms on the GPU Using CUDA” ([Harish & Narayanan, 2007](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref59)).'

- en: Many legacy applications store data as arrays of structures (AoS) that can lead
    to coalescing issues. From a GPU performance perspective, it is preferable to
    store data as a structure of arrays (SoA). [Example 6.22](#tb0115), “An AoS Example,”
    creates an AoS:`struct S {``float x;``float y;``};``struct S myData[N];`Arranging
    data in this fashion leads to coalescing issues as the data are interleaved. Performing
    an operation that only requires the variable **x** will result in a 50 percent
    loss of bandwidth and waste of L2 cache memory.[Example 6.23](#tb0120), “An SoA
    Example,” shows how to allocate an SoA:`struct S {``float x[N];``float y[N];``};``struct
    S myData;`Arranging data as an SoA makes full use of the memory bandwidth even
    when individual elements of the structure are utilized. There is no data interleaving;
    this data structure should provide coalesced memory accesses and achieve high
    global memory performance.The CUDA program *sorting_aos_vs_soa.cu* is included
    in the thrust teaching examples that are available for free download from Google
    Code. It demonstrates how to sort SoA and AoS structures with thrust. The comments
    in the code note that a 5-times speedup can be achieved by using a SoA data structure.

    used to break a computation into subproblems that execute in parallel. *Tiles*
    and *stencils* are an abstraction used in the creation of these multidimensional
    grids. In particular, these abstractions help the programmer group data accesses
    into common patterns plus define shared memory usage for interthread communications
    within a thread block.Matrix multiplication provides the textbook example of the
    use of 2D regions, or *tiles*, on the GPU. The book *Programming Massively Parallel
    Processors: A Hands-on Approach* ([Kirk & Hwu, 2010](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref79))
    has a detailed discussion of matrix multiplication and the use of tiles. However,
    tiles are a common design paradigm used in many problems aside from matrix multiplication.
    The CUDA N-body SDK example is another excellent demonstration of the use of tiles
    to solve a complicated problem on the GPU with high performance.Stencils are a
    generalization of the concept of a tile to *n* dimensions. A stencil computation:■
    Operates on each point in a discrete *n*-dimensional space.■ Uses neighboring
    points in computation.■ Are often surrounded by a time loop.■ Can have diverse
    boundary conditions.Both tiles and stencils help the CUDA developer formulate
    problems to best utilize shared memory and register in the SM as well as exploit
    parallelism across all the SM. The paper “3D Finite Difference Computation on
    GPUs using CUDA” ([Micikevicius, 2010](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref94)) provides
    a detailed discussion of stencils that can be freely downloaded from the NVIDIA
    website. Volkov demonstrates how to use ILP to accelerate stencil problems in
    “Programming Inverse Memory Hierarchy: Case of Stencils on GPUs” ([Volkov, 2010](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref139)).Tiles
    and stencils are also important in performing GPU computations with *quadtrees*
    and *octrees*. A quadtree is a tree-based structure in which each internal node
    has four children. It is used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively
    dividing it into quadrants. An octree has eight children per internal node and
    is used to recursively divide a 3D space into regions. Both of these data structures
    can exhibit irregular global memory accesses. The book *GPU Computing Gems* ([Hwu,
    2011](B978012388426800015X.xhtml#ref72)) contains several detailed examples of
    how experts in the field have used these and other irregular data structures in
    CUDA to solve complex scientific problems.'

  zh: 总结
- en: This chapter introduced techniques and examples to efficiently use GPU memory.
    The three-orders-of-magnitude performance difference between the slowest and fastest
    GPU memory systems means that GPU programmers have the opportunity to capitalize
    on the extreme performance that GPU hardware offers.What makes CUDA so special
    is that it exposes the features of the underlying hardware so that the full potential
    of the hardware can be realized. As the reduction example in this chapter showed,
    it is possible to delve down into the lowest levels of the hardware execution
    model to attain high performance.Thrust, on the other hand, bundled this complexity
    into a simple API call that was used in the very first program in this book. As
    demonstrated in this chapter, generic programming lets CUDA programmers create
    simple, generic methods that fully exploit the capability of the GPU.Much of the
    future in CUDA development lies in creating generic libraries and APIs like thrust
    and CUSP. As these interfaces mature, CUDA programmers will be able to do more
    in less time. The concept is simple:■ Make your life easy and write your code
    with the highest-level API that you feel comfortable using.■ Profile and see where
    the bottlenecks occur. In most cases, the efficient use of global memory will
    likely dominate the application performance.■ Drop down to a lower-level API to
    get the performance needed.■ When possible, write generic methods that can potentially
    be combined into a generic library for others to use.
