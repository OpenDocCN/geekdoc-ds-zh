- en: Kinematic Collision Objects (CO) and Moving Dirichlet Boundary Conditions (BC)
    are crucial in many simulation scenarios. A CO can be considered as a collection
    of BC nodes.

- en: At the start of a time step, it is ideal if the BC nodes can be moved directly
    to their prescribed locations without causing any interpenetrations. This allows
    the simulation to proceed smoothly using the [Degree of Freedom (DOF) elimination
    method](lec5.2-DOF_elimin.html), which ensures the constraints remain feasible.

- en: However, with large time steps, high velocities, or significant deformations,
    directly prescribing BC nodes often leads to interpenetration or "tunneling" artifacts,
    where objects pass through each other unrealistically.

- en: To address these challenges, the penalty method is applied. This method progressively
    adjusts the simulation towards a feasible set where both CO and BC constraints
    are satisfied, and interpenetrations are avoided.
