lists. In each of Pyret and Python, we can use <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">filter</code> and
<code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">map</code> to perform certain operations that yield lists. In Pyret,
we used recursion to aggregate list data into a single value. In
Python, we used for-loops for this task. While we could use recursion
or for-loops for <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">filter</code> and <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">map</code> tasks as well, using
these named operators makes it easier for someone else to quickly read
your code and understand what kind of operation it is performing.</p><p>This observation raises a question though: are there other common code
patterns that get written with recursion or for-loops that would
benefit from specialized handling?</p><p>As an example, imagine that we had a dataclass for airline
flights. Each flight has its origin and destination cities, the flight
code (including the airline name and flight number), and the number of seats on the
flight. Imagine also that we have functions to look up the destination
and seating capacity of individual flights:</p><pre data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">@dataclass
class Flight:
    from_city: str

            Flight('PVD','ORD','CSA-590',50),
            Flight('NYC','ORD','CSA-723',120),
            Flight('ORD','DEN','CSA-145',175),
            Flight('BOS','ORD','CSA-647',80)]

def destination1(for_code: str, flights: list):
   '''get the destination of the flight with the given code'''
   for fl in flights:
      if fl.code == for_code:
          return fl.to_city

def capacity1(for_code: str, flights: list):
   '''get the seating capacity of the flight with the given code'''
   for fl in flights:
      if fl.code == for_code:
          return fl.seats</code></pre><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>Look at the similarity between <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">destination1</code> and

flights looking for the one with the given flight-code, then extract a
piece of information from that flight. The for-loop isn’t doing
anything other than looking for the desired flight data. This suggests
that a <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">find_flight</code> helper could be useful here:</p><pre data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">def find_flight(for_code: str, flights: list):

of information is common in many programs. This is so common, in fact,
that languages provide special data structures and operations just to
help with this task. In Python, this data structure is called a
dictionary (hashmap, hashtable, and
associative arrays are names for similar data structures in other
languages, though there are key nuances that distinguish all these variations).</p><section class="SsectionLevel4" id="section 9.2.1"><h4 class="heading">9.2.1 <a name="(part._.Creating_and_.Using_a_.Dictionary)"/>Creating and Using a Dictionary<a href="#(part._.Creating_and_.Using_a_.Dictionary)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h4><p>A dictionary maps unique values (called keys) to corresponding pieces

dictionaries to represent compound data?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Dataclasses have a fixed number of fields, while directories allow
arbitrary numbers of keys. Dataclass fields can be annotated with
types (which most languages will check when you make new data);
dictionaries can use fixed types for each of keys and values, though
this gets restrictive when using dictionaries to capture dataclasses
with fields of different types. Dataclasses give you a function name
for creating new data, whereas with dictionaries you’d have to create
such a function on your own.</p><p>Overall, dataclasses come with more linguistic support for error
checking: you can’t supply data for the wrong number of fields or
field values of the wrong type. Dictionaries are more flexible: you
can support optional fields more easily, including adding new
fields/keys as a program runs. Each of these makes more sense in some
programming situations.</p><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>Write a function <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">ToDoItem_D</code> that takes a description, due
date, and list of tags and returns a dictionary with keys for each
field of a to-do item.</p></blockquote></blockquote><section class="SsectionLevel5" id="section 0"><h5 class="heading"><a name="(part._.Summary)"/>Summary<a href="#(part._.Summary)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h5><p>Python programmers tend to make substantial use of dictionaries. In
this chapter, we’ve seen dictionaries used in two different settings:</p><ul><li><p>one in which the keys uniquely identify different
entities or individuals among a larger set; the values represent some
consistent type of information about each individual. The dictionary
overall captures information about a large population of individuals,
each with their own key.</p></li><li><p>one in which the keys name fields of compound data; the values
associated with each field can have different types from the values
for other fields. This setting corresponds to the use of dataclasses,
in which a dictionary captures information about one individual; some
other structure (such as a list or another dictionary) would be needed
to hold the dictionaries for each individual.</p></li></ul><p>As a general rule, it is better to use dataclasses for the second
setting when you have a fixed set of fields. The use of dictionaries
for dataclasses is somewhat associated with programming practices in
the Python community (less so in other languages). The first setting,
however, is a common use of dictionaries in nearly all languages,
especially since dictionaries are usually built to provide fast access
to the data associated with a specific key.</p></section></section>&#13;

introduced earlier, as well as an example datum for that class:</p><pre data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">class ToDoItem:
    descr: str
    due: date
    tags: list

milk = ToDoItem("buy milk", date(2020, 7, 27), ["shopping", "home"]</code></pre><p>One could view the field names in the dataclass as akin to keys in a
dictionary. If we did so, we could also capture the <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">milk</code>
datum via a dictionary as follows:</p><pre data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">milk_dict = {"descr": "buy milk",
             "due": date(2020, 7, 27),
             "tags": ["shopping", "home"]
             }</code></pre><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>Create a dictionary to capture the compound datum</p><pre data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">ToDoItem("grade hwk", date(2020, 7, 27), ["teaching"])</code></pre></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>Create a to-do list named <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">myTD_D</code> that contains a list of
dictionaries, rather than a list of dataclasses.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Putting these two approaches side-by-side, here’s the contrast:</p><pre data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode"><code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">myTD_L = [ToDoItem("buy milk", date(2020, 7, 27), ["shopping", "home"]),
          ToDoItem("grade hwk", date(2020, 7, 27), ["teaching"]),
          ToDoItem("meet students", date(2020, 7, 26), ["research"])
         ]

myTD_D = [milk_dict,
          {"descr": "grade hwk",
           "due": date(2020, 7, 27),
           "tags": ["teaching"]
          },
          {"descr": "meet students",
           "due": date(2020, 7, 26),
           "tags": ["research"]
          }
         ]</code></pre><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>What do you see as the benefits and drawbacks of each of dataclasses and
dictionaries to represent compound data?</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Dataclasses have a fixed number of fields, while directories allow
arbitrary numbers of keys. Dataclass fields can be annotated with
types (which most languages will check when you make new data);
dictionaries can use fixed types for each of keys and values, though
this gets restrictive when using dictionaries to capture dataclasses
with fields of different types. Dataclasses give you a function name
for creating new data, whereas with dictionaries you’d have to create
such a function on your own.</p><p>Overall, dataclasses come with more linguistic support for error
checking: you can’t supply data for the wrong number of fields or
field values of the wrong type. Dictionaries are more flexible: you
can support optional fields more easily, including adding new
fields/keys as a program runs. Each of these makes more sense in some
programming situations.</p><blockquote class="Incercise"><p class="IncerciseHeader">Do Now!</p><blockquote class="IncerciseBody"><p>Write a function <code data-lang="text/x-python" class="sourceCode">ToDoItem_D</code> that takes a description, due
date, and list of tags and returns a dictionary with keys for each
field of a to-do item.</p></blockquote></blockquote><section class="SsectionLevel5" id="section 0"><h5 class="heading"><a name="(part._.Summary)"/>Summary<a href="#(part._.Summary)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">🔗</a> </h5><p>Python programmers tend to make substantial use of dictionaries. In

entities or individuals among a larger set; the values represent some
consistent type of information about each individual. The dictionary
overall captures information about a large population of individuals,
each with their own key.</p></li><li><p>one in which the keys name fields of compound data; the values
associated with each field can have different types from the values
