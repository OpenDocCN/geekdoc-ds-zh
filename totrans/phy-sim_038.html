<p>Contact modeling is a crucial aspect of ensuring that solids do not intersect with obstacles or themselves. This topic was briefly touched upon in a previous <a href="lec2.3-contact.html">section</a>. In this lecture, we delve deeper into the specifics of non-interpenetration within the framework of the Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) method. Our focus will be on a simplified yet significant scenario: contact between solids and obstacles that have closed boundaries. This specific focus allows us to thoroughly explore the mechanics and principles of the IPC method in a controlled setting.</p>
