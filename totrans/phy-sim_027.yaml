- en: In the forthcoming chapter, we will delve into boundary treatments, including
    prescribed motion and frictional contact, which are implemented through equality
    or inequality constraints in the optimization framework. This discussion will
    be enriched with practical case studies, illustrating the application of each
    boundary treatment in computational simulations.
