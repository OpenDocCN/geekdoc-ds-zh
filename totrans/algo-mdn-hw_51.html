Instead of calculating theoretical cache hit rates, it often makes more sense to reason about cache performance in more qualitative terms.</p><p>In this context, we can talk about the degree of cache reuse primarily in two ways:</p><ul><li><em>Temporal locality</em> refers to the repeated access of the same data within a relatively small time period, such that the data likely remains cached between the requests.</li><li><em>Spatial locality</em> refers to the use of elements relatively close to each other in terms of their memory locations, such that they are likely fetched in the same memory block.</li></ul><p>In other words, temporal locality is when it is likely that this same memory location will soon be requested again, while spatial locality is when it is likely that a nearby location will be requested right after.</p><p>In this section, we will do some case studies to show how these high-level concepts can help in practical optimization.</p><span class="anchor" id="depth-first-vs-breadth-first"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/external-memory/locality/#depth-first-vs-breadth-first">#</a>Depth-First vs. Breadth-First</h3><p>Consider a divide-and-conquer algorithm such as merge sorting. There are two approaches to implementing it:</p><ul><li>We can implement it recursively, or “depth-first,” the way it is normally implemented: sort the left half, sort the right half and then merge the results.</li><li>We can implement it iteratively, or “breadth-first:” do the lowest “layer” first, looping through the entire dataset and comparing odd elements with even elements, then merge the first two elements with the second two elements, the third two elements with the fourth two elements and so on.</li></ul><p>It seems like the second approach is more cumbersome, but faster — because recursion is always slow, right?</p><p>Generally, recursion is <a href="/hpc/architecture/functions">indeed slow</a>, but this is not the case for this and many similar divide-and-conquer algorithms. Although the iterative approach has the advantage of only doing sequential I/O, the recursive approach has much better temporal locality: when a segment fully fits into the cache, it stays there for all lower layers of recursion, resulting in better access times later on.</p><p>In fact, since we only need to split the array $O(\log \frac{N}{M})$ times until this happens, we would only need to read $O(\frac{N}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ blocks in total, while in the iterative approach the entire array will be read from scratch $O(\log N)$ times no matter what. This results in the speedup of $O(\frac{\log N}{\log N - \log M})$, which may be up to an order of magnitude.</p><p>In practice, there is still some overhead associated with the recursion, and for this reason, it makes sense to use hybrid algorithms where we don’t go all the way down to the base case and instead switch to the iterative code on the lower levels of recursion.</p><span class="anchor" id="dynamic-programming"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/external-memory/locality/#dynamic-programming">#</a>Dynamic Programming</h3><p>Similar reasoning can be applied to the implementations of dynamic programming algorithms but leading to the reverse result. Consider the classic <em>knapsack problem:</em> given $N$ items with positive integer costs $c_i$, pick a subset of items with the maximum total cost that does not exceed a given constant $W$.</p><p>The way to solve it is to introduce the <em>state</em> $f[n, w]$, which corresponds to the maximum total cost not exceeding $w$ that can be achieved using only the first $n$ items. These values can be computed in $O(1)$ time per entry if we consider either taking or not taking the $n$-th item and using the previous states of the dynamic to make the optimal decision.</p><p>Python has a handy <code>lru_cache</code> decorator which can be used for implementing it with memoized recursion:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nd">@lru_cache</span>
