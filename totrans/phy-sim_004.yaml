- en: Having defined a method for representing a solid geometry at a single instance
    in time, we now face the challenge of predicting the solid's motion and deformation
    over time. This prediction is a key component for accurate simulation.

    that forces \(\mathbf{f}\) are the primary reasons for changes in velocity, as
    indicated by acceleration \(\mathbf{a}\). It''s important to understand that when
    a solid''s displacement fields extend beyond simple translational or rotational
    movements, or a linear combination thereof, it indicates deformation. By applying
    Newton''s second law to each sample point, we can effectively predict the movement
    and deformation of solids. This concept is concisely represented in vector form:'

- en: In this representation, \(M\in\mathbb{R}^{dn\times dn}\) is the mass matrix,
    and \(x\), \(v\), and \(f\) are the column vectors stacking position, velocity,
    and force, respectively. This approach lays the groundwork for our simulations
    of deformable solids, integrating principles of motion in both discrete space
    and continuous time.

- en: '***Remark 1.2.1 (Stacked Variables).*** Though the mass matrix \(M\) isn''t
    necessarily a diagonal matrix in theory, it''s often simplified to one in practical
    applications. This results in a *lumped* mass matrix, representing a system of
    discrete point masses and offering an efficient way to handle complex systems.
    Consider a two-point system in two dimensions to illustrate this. The lumped mass
    matrix for such a system is represented as: \[ M = \begin{pmatrix} m_1 & & & \\
    & m_1 & & \\ & & m_2 & \\ & & & m_2 \end{pmatrix}, \] Here, we assume vectors
    like \({v}\) (as well as \({x}\) and \({f}\)) are stacked in a specific order:
    \[ v = (v_{11}, v_{12}, v_{21}, v_{22})^T, \] where \(v_{i\alpha}\) denotes the
    \(\alpha\)th component of the velocity \(\mathbf{v}_i\) for the \(i\)th point.
    Such an organized structure simplifies calculations significantly and enhances
    the understanding of the system''s dynamics.'
