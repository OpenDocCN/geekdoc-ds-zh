- en: This book is intended to be a relatively gentle introduction to carrying out
    Bayesian data analysis and cognitive modeling using the probabilistic programming
    language Stan (Carpenter et al. [2017](#ref-carpenter2017stan)), and the front-end
    to Stan called `brms` (Bürkner [2024](#ref-R-brms)). Our target audience is cognitive
    scientists (e.g., linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists) who carry
    out planned behavioral experiments, and who are interested in learning the Bayesian
    data analysis methodology from the ground up and in a principled manner. Our aim
    is to make Bayesian statistics a standard part of the data analysis toolkit for
    experimental linguistics, psycholinguistics, psychology, and related disciplines.

- en: Many excellent introductory textbooks already exist for Bayesian data analysis.
    Why write yet another book? Our text is different from other attempts in two respects.
    First, our main focus is on showing how to analyze data from planned experiments
    involving repeated measures; this type of experimental data involves unique complexities.
    We provide many examples of data sets involving time measurements (e.g., self-paced
    reading, eye-tracking-while-reading, voice onset time), event-related potentials,
    pupil sizes, accuracies (e.g., recall tasks, yes-no questions), categorical answers
    (e.g., picture naming), choice-reaction time (e.g, the Stroop task, the motion
    detection task), etc. Second, from the very outset, we emphasize a particular
    workflow that has as its centerpiece simulating data; we aim to teach a philosophy
    that involves thinking hard about the assumed underlying generative process, **even
    before the data are collected**. The data analysis approach that we hope to teach
    through this book involves a cycle of prior predictive and posterior predictive
    checks, sensitivity analyses, and model validation using simulated data. We try
    to inculcate a sense of how inferences can be drawn from the posterior distribution
    of theoretically interesting parameters without resorting to binary decisions
    like “significant” or “not-significant.” We are hopeful that this will set a new
    standard for reporting and interpreting results of data analyses in a more nuanced
    manner, and lead to more measured claims in the published literature.

- en: 'A commonly-held belief in psychology, psycholinguistics, and other areas is
    that statistical data analysis is secondary to the science, and should be quick
    and easy. For example, a senior mathematical psychologist once told the last author
    of this book: “if you need to run anything more complicated than a paired t-test,
    you are asking the wrong question.” We take a different perspective here: the
    science and the statistical modeling are one unitary thing. The statistical model
    should represent some reasonable approximation of the latent cognitive processes
    that are assumed to be in play.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The target audience for this book is students and researchers who want to treat
    statistics as an equal partner in their scientific work. We expect that the reader
    is willing to take the time to both understand and to run the computational analyses.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any rigorous introduction to Bayesian data analysis requires at least a passive
    knowledge of probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra. However, we do
    not require that the reader has this background when they start the book. Instead,
    the relevant ideas are introduced informally and just in time, as soon as they
    are needed. The reader is never required to have an active ability to solve probability
    problems, to solve integrals or compute derivatives, or to carry out matrix computations
    (such as inverting matrices) by hand. There are a few places where the discussion
    becomes technical and requires some knowledge of calculus or related topics. However,
    the reader unfamiliar with the required mathematics can simply skip those sections,
    as these are not really necessary to follow the main thread of the book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'What we do expect is familiarity with arithmetic, basic set theory and elementary
    probability theory (e.g., sum and product rules, conditional probability), simple
    matrix operations like addition and multiplication, and simple algebraic operations.
    A quick look through chapter 1 of Gill ([2006](#ref-gill2006essential)) before
    starting this book is highly recommended. We also presuppose that, when the need
    arises, the reader is willing to look up concepts that that they might have forgotten
    (e.g., logarithms). We also provide a self-paced course on some basic concepts
    in mathematics (aimed at non-mathematicians) which the reader can work through:
    see [https://vasishth.github.io/FoM/](https://vasishth.github.io/FoM/).'

- en: We also expect that the reader already knows and/or is willing to learn enough
    of the programming language R (R Core Team [2023](#ref-R-base)) to reproduce the
    examples presented and to carry out the exercises. If the reader is completely
    unfamiliar with R, before starting this book they should first consult books like
    [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/).
    Readers familiar with python may find the python port of the first five chapters
    by Jozsef Arato useful ([https://github.com/jozsarato/bayescogdat](https://github.com/jozsarato/bayescogdat)).

    mixed models (Bates, Mächler, et al. [2015](#ref-R-lme4); Baayen, Davidson, and
    Bates [2008](#ref-baayen2008mixed)). What this means in practice is that the reader
    should have used the `lm()` and `lmer()` functions in R. A passing acquaintance
    with basic statistical concepts, like the correlation between two variables, is
    also taken for granted.

    freely online (Vasishth, Schad, et al. [2021](#ref-VasishthEtAlFreq2021)). This
    latter book will prepare the reader well for the material presented here.

    of such a can-do spirit are nicely summarized in the book by Burger and Starbird
    ([2012](#ref-burger)); also see Levy ([2021](#ref-danlevy)). Although we cannot
    summarize all the insights from these books in a few words, inspired by the Burger
