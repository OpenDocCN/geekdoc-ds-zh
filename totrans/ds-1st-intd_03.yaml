- en: 'We’d like to thank everyone that has contributed to the development of [*Data
    Science: A First Introduction*](https://datasciencebook.ca). This is an open source
    textbook that began as a collection of course readings for DSCI 100, a new introductory
    data science course at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Several faculty
    members in the UBC Department of Statistics were pivotal in shaping the direction
    of that course, and as such, contributed greatly to the broad structure and list
    of topics in this book. We would especially like to thank Matías Salibían-Barrera
    for his mentorship during the initial development and roll-out of both DSCI 100
    and this book. His door was always open when we needed to chat about how to best
    introduce and teach data science to our first-year students. We would also like
    to thank Gabriela Cohen Freue for her DSCI 561 (Regression I) teaching materials
    from the UBC Master of Data Science program, as some of our linear regression
    figures were inspired from these.'

  zh: 我们想要感谢所有为[*数据科学：第一入门*](https://datasciencebook.ca)的发展做出贡献的人。这是一本开源教科书，最初是作为不列颠哥伦比亚大学（UBC）新开的数据科学入门课程DSCI
    100的课程阅读材料集合。UBC统计学系的几位教员在塑造该课程方向方面发挥了关键作用，因此对本书的广泛结构和主题列表做出了巨大贡献。我们特别感谢Matías
    Salibían-Barrera在DSCI 100和本书的初始开发和推广过程中的指导。当我们需要讨论如何最好地向一年级学生介绍和教授数据科学时，他的门总是为我们敞开。我们还要感谢Gabriela
    Cohen Freue提供的UBC数据科学硕士项目的DSCI 561（回归I）教学材料，因为我们的部分线性回归图表受到了这些材料的影响。

    this book. In particular, we would like to thank all of our reviewers for their
    feedback and suggestions: Rohan Alexander, Isabella Ghement, Virgilio Gómez Rubio,
    Albert Kim, Adam Loy, Maria Prokofieva, Emily Riederer, and Greg Wilson. The book
    was improved substantially by their insights. We would like to give special thanks
    to Jim Zidek for his support and encouragement throughout the process, and to
    Roger Peng for graciously offering to write the Foreword.'

    Virgilio Gómez Rubio, Albert Kim, Adam Loy, Maria Prokofieva, Emily Riederer,
    和 Greg Wilson。他们的洞察力大大提高了这本书的质量。我们特别感谢Jim Zidek在整个过程中给予的支持和鼓励，以及Roger Peng慷慨地提供撰写序言。
- en: Finally, we owe a debt of gratitude to all of the students of DSCI 100 over
    the past few years. They provided invaluable feedback on the book and worksheets;
    they found bugs for us (and stood by very patiently in class while we frantically
    fixed those bugs); and they brought a level of enthusiasm to the class that sustained
    us during the hard work of creating a new course and writing a textbook. Our interactions
    with them taught us how to teach data science, and that learning is reflected
    in the content of this book.

  zh: 最后，我们衷心感谢过去几年中所有DSCI 100的学生。他们对书籍和工作表提供了宝贵的反馈；他们为我们找出了错误（并且在课堂上非常耐心地等待我们紧张地修复这些错误）；并且他们为课程带来了热情，这支撑我们在创建新课程和编写教科书时的辛勤工作。与他们互动教会了我们如何教授数据科学，这种学习体现在这本书的内容中。
