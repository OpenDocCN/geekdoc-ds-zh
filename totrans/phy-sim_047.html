<p>To mitigate tunneling issues in solid simulation with large time steps, it is crucial to enforce non-negativity constraints of signed distances between solids and obstacles throughout the entire motion trajectory, not just at the final solution.</p>
<p>While directly using the optimization path to approximate the motion trajectory isn't perfect theoretically, it supports the design of a filter line search scheme. This scheme utilizes continuous collision detection (CCD) and the projected Newton method, effectively preventing tunneling in practical scenarios.</p>
<p>The projected Newton method, a gradient-based approach for minimizing the Incremental Potential, requires that the potential energy has a continuous gradient. Consequently, the distance functions employed in our barrier potential need to be at least <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"/><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"/><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> continuous. For grid-based signed distance fields (<a href="lec7.1-signed_dists.html#exp:lec7:grid_sdf">Example 7.1.3</a>), mere bilinear interpolation is considered insufficient.</p>
<p>Additionally, handling self-contact on the piece-wise linear boundary of a mesh necessitates further approximations to smooth the distance function. Detailed exploration of self-contact will be addressed in <a href="lec20-pw_linear_boundary.html">future sections</a>. Before that, we will first transition to discussing solids-obstacle friction in our next lecture.</p>
