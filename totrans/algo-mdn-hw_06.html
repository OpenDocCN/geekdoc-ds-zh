</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Assembly is very simple in the sense that it doesn’t have many syntactical constructions compared to high-level programming languages. From what you can observe from the examples above:</p><ul><li>A program is a sequence of instructions, each written as its name followed by a variable number of operands.</li><li>The <code>[reg]</code> syntax is used for “dereferencing” a pointer stored in a register, and on x86 you need to prefix it with size information (<code>DWORD</code> here means 32 bit).</li><li>The <code>;</code> sign is used for line comments, similar to <code>#</code> and <code>//</code> in other languages.</li></ul><p>Assembly is a very minimal language because it needs to be. It reflects the machine language as closely as possible, up to the point where there is almost 1:1 correspondence between machine code and assembly. In fact, you can turn any compiled program back into its assembly form using a process called <em>disassembly</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> — although everything non-essential like comments will not be preserved.</p><p>Note that the two snippets above are not just syntactically different. Both are optimized codes produced by a compiler, but the Arm version uses 4 instructions, while the x86 version uses 3. The <code>add eax, [rdi]</code> instruction is what’s called <em>fused instruction</em> that does a load and an add in one go — this is one of the perks that the <a href="../isa#risc-vs-cisc">CISC</a> approach can provide.</p><p>Since there are far more differences between the architectures than just this one, from here on and for the rest of the book we will only provide examples for x86, which is probably what most of our readers will optimize for, although many of the introduced concepts will be architecture-agnostic.</p><span class="anchor" id="instructions-and-registers"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/assembly/#instructions-and-registers">#</a>Instructions and Registers</h3><p>For historical reasons, instruction mnemonics in most assembly languages are very terse. Back when people used to write assembly by hand and repeatedly wrote the same set of common instructions, one less character to type was one step away from insanity.</p><p>For example, <code>mov</code> is for “store/load a word,” <code>inc</code> is for “increment by 1,” <code>mul</code> is for “multiply,” and <code>idiv</code> is for “integer division.” You can look up the description of an instruction by its name in <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/">one of x86 references</a>, but most instructions do what you’d think they do.</p><p>Most instructions write their result into the first operand, which can also be involved in the computation like in the <code>add eax, [rdi]</code> example we saw before. Operands can be either registers, constant values, or memory locations.</p><p><strong>Registers</strong> are named <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsp</code>, and <code>r8</code>-<code>r15</code> for a total of 16 of them. The “letter” ones are named like that for historical reasons: <code>rax</code> is “accumulator,” <code>rcx</code> is “counter,” <code>rdx</code> is “data” and so on — but, of course, they don’t have to be used only for that.</p><p>There are also 32-, 16-bit and 8-bit registers that have similar names (<code>rax</code> → <code>eax</code> → <code>ax</code> → <code>al</code>). They are not fully separate but <em>aliased</em>: the lowest 32 bits of <code>rax</code> are <code>eax</code>, the lowest 16 bits of <code>eax</code> are <code>ax</code>, and so on. This is made to save die space while maintaining compatibility, and it is also the reason why basic type casts in compiled programming languages are usually free.</p><p>These are just the <em>general-purpose</em> registers that you can, with <a href="../functions">some exceptions</a>, use however you like in most instructions. There is also a separate set of registers for <a href="/hpc/arithmetic/float">floating-point arithmetic</a>, a bunch of very wide registers used in <a href="/hpc/simd">vector extensions</a>, and a few special ones that are needed for <a href="../loops">control flow</a>, but we’ll get there in time.</p><p><strong>Constants</strong> are just integer or floating-point values: <code>42</code>, <code>0x2a</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>6.02e23</code>. They are more commonly called <em>immediate values</em> because they are embedded right into the machine code. Because it may considerably increase the complexity of the instruction encoding, some instructions don’t support immediate values or allow just a fixed subset of them. In some cases, you have to load a constant value into a register and then use it instead of an immediate value.</p><p>Apart from numeric values, there are also string constants such as <code>hello</code> or <code>world\n</code> with their own little subset of operations, but that is a somewhat obscure corner of the assembly language that we are not going to explore here.</p><span class="anchor" id="moving-data"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/assembly/#moving-data">#</a>Moving Data</h3><p>Some instructions may have the same mnemonic, but have different operand types, in which case they are considered distinct instructions as they may perform slightly different operations and take different times to execute. The <code>mov</code> instruction is a vivid example of that, as it comes in around 20 different forms, all related to moving data: either between the memory and registers or just between two registers. Despite the name, it doesn’t <em>move</em> a value into a register, but <em>copies</em> it, preserving the original.</p><p>When used to copy data between two registers, the <code>mov</code> instruction instead performs <em>register renaming</em> internally — informs the CPU that the value referred by register X is actually stored in register Y — without causing any additional delay except for maybe reading and decoding the instruction itself. For the same reason, the <code>xchg</code> instruction that swaps two registers also doesn’t cost anything.</p><p>As we’ve seen above with the fused <code>add</code>, you don’t have to use <code>mov</code> for every memory operation: some arithmetic instructions conveniently support memory locations as operands.</p><span class="anchor" id="addressing-modes"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/assembly/#addressing-modes">#</a>Addressing Modes</h3><p>Memory addressing is done with the <code>[]</code> operator, but it can do more than just reinterpret a value stored in a register as a memory location. The address operand takes up to 4 parameters presented in the syntax:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>SIZE PTR [base + index * scale + displacement]
</code></pre><p>where <code>displacement</code> needs to be an integer constant and <code>scale</code> can be either 2, 4, or 8. What it does is calculate the pointer <code>base + index * scale + displacement</code> and dereferences it.</p><p>Using complex addressing is <a href="/hpc/cpu-cache/pointers">at most one cycle slower</a> than dereferencing a pointer directly, and it can be useful when you have, for example, an array of structures and want to load a specific field of its $i$-th element.</p><p>Addressing operator needs to be prefixed with a size specifier for how many bits of data are needed:</p><ul><li><code>BYTE</code> for 8 bits</li><li><code>WORD</code> for 16 bits</li><li><code>DWORD</code> for 32 bits</li><li><code>QWORD</code> for 64 bits</li></ul><p>There is also a more rare <code>TBYTE</code> for <a href="/hpc/arithmetic/float">80 bits</a>, and <code>XMMWORD</code>, <code>YMMWORD</code>, and <code>ZMMWORD</code> for <a href="/hpc/simd">128, 256, and 512 bits</a> respectively. All these types don’t have to be written in uppercase, but this is how most compilers emit them.</p><p>The address computation is often useful by itself: the <code>lea</code> (“load effective address”) instruction calculates the memory address of the operand and stores it in a register in one cycle, without doing any actual memory operations. While its intended use is for actually computing memory addresses, it is also often used as an arithmetic trick that would otherwise involve 1 multiplication and 2 additions — for example, you can multiply by 3, 5, and 9 with it.</p><p>It also frequently serves as a replacement for <code>add</code> because it doesn’t need a separate <code>mov</code> instruction if you need to move the result somewhere else: <code>add</code> only works in the two-register <code>a += b</code> mode, while <code>lea</code> lets you do <code>a = b + c</code> (or even <code>a = b + c + d</code> if one of them is a constant).</p><span class="anchor" id="alternative-syntax"/><h3><a class="anchor-link" href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/assembly/#alternative-syntax">#</a>Alternative Syntax</h3><p>There are actually multiple <em>assemblers</em> (the programs that produce machine code from assembly) with different assembly languages, but only two x86 syntaxes are widely used now. They are commonly called after the two companies that used them and had a dominant influence on programming during that era:</p><ul><li>The <em>AT&amp;T syntax</em>, used by default by all Linux tools.</li><li>The <em>Intel syntax</em>, used by default, well, by Intel.</li></ul><p>These syntaxes are also sometimes called <em>GAS</em> and <em>NASM</em> respectively, by the names of the two primary assemblers that use them (<em>GNU Assembler</em> and <em>Netwide Assembler</em>).</p><p>We used Intel syntax in this chapter and will continue to preferably use it for the rest of the book. For comparison, here is how the same <code>*c = *a + *b</code> example looks like in AT&amp;T asm:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">movl</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">%rsi</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nv">%eax</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">addl</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">%rdi</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nv">%eax</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nf">movl</span> <span class="nv">%eax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">%rdx</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The key differences can be summarized as follows:</p><ol><li>The <em>last</em> operand is used to specify the destination.</li><li>Registers and constants need to be prefixed by <code>%</code> and <code>$</code> respectively (e.g., <code>addl $1, %rdx</code> increments <code>rdx</code>).</li><li>Memory addressing looks like this: <code>displacement(%base, %index, scale)</code>.</li><li>Both <code>;</code> and <code>#</code> can be used for line comments, and also <code>/* */</code> can be used for block comments.</li></ol><p>And, most importantly, in AT&amp;T syntax, the instruction names need to be “suffixed” (<code>addq</code>, <code>movl</code>, <code>cmpq</code>, etc.) to specify what size operands are being manipulated:</p><ul><li><code>b</code> = byte (8 bit)</li><li><code>w</code> = word (16 bit)</li><li><code>l</code> = long (32 bit integer or 64-bit floating-point)</li><li><code>q</code> = quad (64 bit)</li><li><code>s</code> = single (32-bit floating-point)</li><li><code>t</code> = ten bytes (80-bit floating-point)</li></ul><p>In Intel syntax, this information is inferred from operands (which is why you also need to specify sizes of pointers).</p><p>Most tools that produce or consume x86 assembly can do so in both syntaxes, so you can just pick the one you like more and don’t worry.</p><section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"><hr/><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>On Linux, to disassemble a compiled program, you can call <code>objdump -d {path-to-binary}</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></article><div class="nextprev"><div class="left"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/isa/" id="prev-article">← Instruction Set Architectures</a></div><div class="right"><a href="https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/loops/" id="next-article">Loops and Conditionals →</a></div></div>
