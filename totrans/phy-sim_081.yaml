    where Bϵt​ is the world space counterpart of Bϵ0​ (the ball of radius ϵ surrounding
    an arbitrary X∈Ω0). This is arguably a natural definition since mass(Bϵt​) should
    be a measurable quantity. Conservation of mass can be expressed as mass(Bϵt​)=mass(Bϵ0​),∀ Bϵ0​⊂Ω0 and t≥0.(16.1.2)

    [(16.1.1)](#eq:lec16:mass_def) becomes R(X,t)=ϵ→+0lim​∫Bϵ0​​J(X,t)dXmass(Bϵt​)​,(16.1.3)
    and so R(X,0)=ϵ→+0lim​∫Bϵ0​​dXmass(Bϵ0​)​(16.1.4) since J(X,0)=1. Then combining
    Equations [(16.1.2)](#eq:lec16:mass_conservation), [(16.1.3)](#eq:lec16:R_X_t_formula),
    and [(16.1.4)](#eq:lec16:R_X_0_formula), we can express the conservation of mass
    as ∫Bϵ0​​R(X,t)J(X,t)dX=∫Bϵ0​​R(X,0)dX,∀ Bϵ0​⊂Ω0 and t≥0. This just says that
    the mass in Bϵt​ (as expressed via an integral of the mass density) should not
    change with time. This set is associated with a subset of the material at time
    t and as it evolves in the flow, the material will take up more or less space,
    but there will always be the same amount (mass) of material in the set. Since
    Bϵ0​ is arbitrary, it must be true that R(X,t)J(X,t)=R(X,0),∀ X∈Ω0 and t≥0.

- en: '***Remark 16.1.1 (Lagrangian and Eulerian Views).*** In simulation methods
    that discretize and track materials directly based on Ω0, conservation of mass
    is inherently satisfied. For instance, in our Finite Element Method (FEM) simulator,
    Ω0 is segmented into triangles, with the mass of each triangle remaining constant
    regardless of deformation throughout the simulation. This approach is known as
    the **Lagrangian method**. In contrast, **Eulerian methods** discretize and evolve
    physical quantities based on Ωt and often need to specially deal with mass conservation.'
