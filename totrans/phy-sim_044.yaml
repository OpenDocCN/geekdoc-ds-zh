- en: '****Example 8.1.1 (Tunneling).**** Let''s consider a simple illustrative example.
    Without external forces like gravity, for a particle (no elasticity) at \(\mathbf{x}_0
    = (0, 0)\) with mass \(m\) and initial velocity \(\mathbf{v}_0 = (1, 0)\) hitting
    a fixed square obstacle centered at \((0.005, 0) \), the Incremental Potential
    minimization problem for the first time step is xmin​(2m​∥x−(x0​+hv0​)∥2+h2Pb​(x)).(8.1.1)
    Since \(\hat{d}\) is usually set small enough such as \(10^{-4}m\) in this case,
    the barrier potential \(P_b(\mathbf{x})\) is not yet active at \(\mathbf{x}_0\)
    as the particle is not touching the obstacle. This makes the problem in Equation
    [(8.1.1)](#eq:lec8:ip_particle_hit_square) quadratic, and our projected Newton
    (PN) method ([Algorithm 3.3.1](lec3.3-grad_based_opt.html#alg:lec3:PN_method_IE))
    will produce a search direction p=hv0​ at the first iteration, which directly
    leads to the global minimum of the Incremental Potential at \(\mathbf{x}_0 + h\mathbf{v}_0\)
    after line search. Taking \(h=0.01s\) ([Figure 8.1.1](#fig:lec8:filter_ls)), the
    particle will tunnel through the obstacle. However, scenarios where particles
    pass through obstacles due to large time steps are clearly unrealistic, as the
    expected physical behavior is for the particle to collide with the obstacle and
    either stop or bounce back.'

    Newton method introduced earlier, tunneling artifact could happen as shown in
    the middle. The physically plausible result shown on the right could be obtained
    with the filter line search scheme. The blue arrows show the optimization path.'

- en: From [Example 8.1.1](#exp:lec8:tunneling), we understand that simply ensuring
    the signed distances to be non-negative at the final solution is inadequate, especially
    in scenarios involving large time step sizes, high-speed impacts, or thin obstacles.
    These conditions can lead to inaccuracies and unrealistic outcomes in simulations.

- en: The Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) method addresses this issue by ensuring
    that distances remain non-zero across the entire motion trajectory of solids.
    This approach is crucial for maintaining the physical accuracy and realism of
    the simulation.
