- en: In previous case studies, we've relied on the mass-spring model to simulate
    the elastic behaviors of solids. This model approximates 2D and 3D elasticity
    by connecting multiple springs in various directions, each responding only to
    stretch and compression. However, this simple approximation often fails to capture
    the complexities of real-world phenomena. Starting with this lecture, we will
    delve into the mathematical description of deformation and introduce a more rigorous
    approach to modeling elasticity for continuum bodies.

    **continuum assumption**. This perspective treats materials—whether solid, liquid,
    or gas—as continuous entities, avoiding the need to account for microscopic interactions
    between molecules and atoms. This assumption is not only practical in engineering
    and graphics applications but is also prevalent in everyday scenarios.

- en: In graphics simulations, the continuum assumption applies to a wide range of
    materials, including deformable objects (both elastic and plastic), muscle, flesh,
    cloth, hair, liquids, smoke, gas, and granular materials like sand, snow, mud,
    and soil. In continuum mechanics, properties such as density, velocity, and force
    are defined as continuous functions of position. We have explored their discrete
    counterparts in the [Discrete Space and Time](lec1-discrete_space_time.html) section.

    domain and evolved over time to simulate the dynamic behaviors of these materials.
