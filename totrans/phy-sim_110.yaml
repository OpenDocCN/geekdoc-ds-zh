- en: We have implemented frictionless self-contact with guaranteed non-intersection
    for 2D FEM simulations by discretizing barrier energies onto the non-incident
    point-edge pairs on the boundary.

- en: To compute the barrier energies, we used squared point-edge distances to avoid
    potential numerical issues. The point-edge distance is a piecewise smooth function
    with closed-form expressions depending on the relative positions of the point
    and the edge, and the overall function is C1-continuous everywhere. The derivatives
    of the function can be conveniently obtained by applying symbolic differentiation
    to each expression.

- en: For line search filtering, instead of directly computing the time of impact
    (TOI) which is prone to numerical issues, we implemented the additive CCD method
    (ACCD) to obtain a sufficiently large and conservative estimate of TOI. ACCD is
    an iterative method that accumulates lower bounds of TOI while progressively advancing
    the nodes along the search direction. Before running ACCD, we perform overlap
    checks on the bounding boxes of the point's and edge's spans to quickly filter
    out non-colliding pairs.

    spatial indexing strategies such as spatial hashing and bounding box hierarchies
    (BVH) will be needed to significantly reduce the expensive spatial search costs.
