    on which you can build and share knowledge about an aspect of the world that interests
    you based on data that you observe. Telling stories in small groups around a fire
    played a critical role in the development of humans and society ([Wiessner 2014](99-references.html#ref-wiessner2014embers)).
    Today our stories, based on data, can influence millions.

    both of these things. I focus on tools, approaches, and workflows that enable
    you to establish lasting and reproducible knowledge.

    will be at the center of most of our stories, and we will tell social, cultural,
    and economic stories. In particular, throughout this book I will draw attention
    to inequity both in social phenomena and in data. Most data analysis reflects
    the world as it is. Many of the least well-off face a double burden in this regard:
    not only are they disadvantaged, but the extent is more difficult to measure.
    Respecting those whose data are in our dataset is a primary concern, and so is
    thinking of those who are systematically not in our dataset.'

    by other people. Scientific and economic progress can only be made by building
    on the work of others. And this is only possible if we can understand what they
    did. Similarly, if we are to create knowledge about the world, then we must enable
    others to understand precisely what we did, what we found, and how we went about
    our tasks. As such, in this book I will be particularly prescriptive about communication
    and reproducibility.

    specifics of what is happening. That workflow is: plan, simulate, acquire, model,

    through essential concepts from sampling that govern our approach to data. It
    then considers datasets that are explicitly provided for us to use as data, for
    instance censuses and other government statistics. These are typically clean,
    well-documented, pre-packaged datasets. [7  APIs, scraping, and parsing](07-gather.html)
    covers aspects like using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), scraping
    data, getting data from PDFs, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The idea
    is that data are available, but not necessarily designed to be datasets, and that
    we must go and get them. Finally, [8  Experiments and surveys](08-hunt.html) covers
    aspects where more is expected of us. For instance, we may need to conduct an

    and preparing data, and then goes through specific steps to take and checks to
    implement. [10  Store and share](10-store_and_share.html) focuses on methods of
    storing and retrieving those datasets, including the use of R data packages and
    parquet. It then continues onto considerations and steps to take when wanting
    to disseminate datasets as broadly as possible, while at the same time respecting

    of linear models to explore data is introduced. And [13  Generalized linear models](13-ijaglm.html)
    considers generalized linear models, including logistic, Poisson, and negative
    binomial regression. It also introduces multilevel modeling.

    from observational data](14-causality_from_obs.html) focuses on making causal
    claims from observational data and covers approaches such as difference-in-differences,
    regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. [16  Multilevel regression
    with post-stratification](15-mrp.html) introduces multilevel regression with post-stratification,
    which is where we use a statistical model to adjust a sample for known biases.

    learn how to use data to tell convincing stories. I try to develop students that
    are skilled not only in using statistical methods across various disciplines,
    but also appreciate their limitations, and think deeply about the broader contexts
    of their work. I teach in both the Faculty of Information and the Department of
    Statistical Sciences at both undergraduate and graduate levels. I am a RStudio
    Certified Tidyverse Trainer.

    of the Credit, the Huron-Wendat, and the Seneca. Data have long been used to oppress

    suggestions for improving this book. For this I am indebted to Albert Rapp, Alex
    Hayes, Alex Luscombe (who also suggested the Police Violence “Oh, you think\(\dots\)”

    A Mahfouz made me realize that that covering Poisson regression was critical.
    Aaron Miller suggested the FINER framework. Alison Presmanes Hill suggested Wordbank.
    Chris Warshaw suggested the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group survey data. Christina
    Wei pointed out many code errors. Claire Battershill directed me toward many books
    about writing. Ella Kaye suggested, and rightly insisted on, moving to Quarto.
    Faria Khandaker suggested what became the “R essentials” chapter. Hareem Naveed
    generously shared her industry experience. Heath Priston provided assistance with
    Toronto homelessness data. Jessica Gronsbell gave invaluable suggestions around
    statistical practice. Keli Chiu reinforced the importance of text-as-data. Leslie
    Root came up with the idea of “Oh, you think we have good data on that!”. Michael
    Chong shaped my approach to EDA. Michael Donnelly, Peter Hepburn, and Léo Raymond-Belzile
    provided pointers to classic papers that I was unaware of, in political science,
    sociology, and statistics, respectively. Nick Horton suggested the Hadley Wickham
    video in [11  Exploratory data analysis](11-eda.html). Paul Hodgetts taught me
    how to make R packages and made the cover art for this book. Radu Craiu ensured
    sampling was afforded its appropriate place. Sharla Gelfand the approaches I advocate
    around how to use R. Thomas William Rosenthal made me realize the potential of
    Shiny. Tom Cardoso and Zane Schwartz were excellent sources of data put together
    by journalists. Yanbo Tang assisted with Nancy Reid’s “Shoulders of giants” entry.
    Finally, Chris Maddison and Maia Balint suggested the closing poem.

    many times. Thank you for your inestimable help with writing this book, providing
    the base on which it builds (remember in the library showing me many times how
    to get certain rows in R!), giving me the time that I needed to write, encouragement
    when it turned out that writing a book just meant endlessly rewriting that which
    was perfect the day before, reading everything in this book many times, making
    coffee or cocktails as appropriate, looking after the children, and more.
