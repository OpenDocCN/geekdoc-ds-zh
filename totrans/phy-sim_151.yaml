- en: In this lecture, we discussed various boundary treatment strategies essential
    for accurate and stable MPM simulations. Initially, we highlighted that boundary
    conditions (BCs) must be applied directly to the grid nodes due to their role
    as the true degrees of freedom satisfying Newton's second law. We presented several
    common grid-level boundary conditions, including sticky, slip, and separate (one-way)
    conditions, along with practical methods for incorporating frictional contact
    through Coulomb friction constraints using signed distance functions (SDFs).

    such as inaccurate normals and discretization gaps, motivating the use of particle-level
    frictional contact formulations. By formulating frictional contact explicitly
    as an optimization problem at the grid level, with particle-based contact energies,
    we provided a physically consistent and robust approach. Specifically, we introduced
    a two-stage scheme where free-motion grid velocities are computed first, followed
    by an optimization-based frictional contact correction, effectively enforcing
    static friction and maintaining physical fidelity in complex contact scenarios.

    implement a practical, full-featured MPM simulation. We begin with a quick-start
    example: [**Two Colliding Elastic Blocks in 2D**](./lec29-mpm_elastic_case_study.html),
    showcasing the simplest MPM elastic body simulation based on PIC. Then, with minimal
    additional effort, we incorporate APIC transfer scheme, sand plasticity and an
    SDF-based collider to create a more advanced, [**2D Sand Simulation**](./lec30-mpm_sand_case_study.html).'
