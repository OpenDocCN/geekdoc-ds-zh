- en: In this lecture, we discretized the weak form of momentum conservation in both
    space and time, arriving at the system of equations for backward Euler time integration
    introduced in [the first lecture](./lec1-discrete_space_time.html).

- en: For spatial discretization, a finite number of points are sampled within the
    domain, and their displacements are used as the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the
    simulation. With the interpolation function associated with each DOF, the displacement
    at any point in the domain can be approximated, limiting the solution of the weak
    form to d n-dimensional function spaces formed by mutually orthogonal interpolation
    functions, where n represents the number of sample points. In this way, the test
    function Q can be conveniently assigned to generate nd equations for solving the
    nd unknowns.

    time integration rules. By applying mass lumping and assuming zero traction boundary
    conditions, we can ultimately derive the discrete form. The integration of interpolation
    functions will be covered in the next chapter.
