    on a keyboard; key presses are somehow detected by the OS and get sent to the
    browser; browser parses the URL and asks the OS to make a network request; then
    comes DNS, routing, TCP, HTTP, and all the other OSI layers; browser parses HTML;
    JavaScript works its magic; some representation of a page gets sent over to GPU
    for rendering; image frames get sent to the monitor… and each of these steps probably
    involves doing dozens of more specific things in the process.

- en: Hardware engineers love abstractions too. An abstraction of a CPU is called
    an *instruction set architecture* (ISA), and it defines how a computer should
    work from a programmer’s perspective. Similar to software interfaces, it gives
    computer engineers the ability to improve on existing CPU designs while also giving
    its users — us, programmers — the confidence that things that worked before won’t
    break on newer chips.

- en: 'An ISA essentially defines how the hardware should interpret the machine language.
    Apart from instructions and their binary encodings, an ISA also defines the counts,
    sizes, and purposes of registers, the memory model, and the input/output model.
    Similar to software interfaces, ISAs can be extended too: in fact, they are often
    updated, mostly in a backward-compatible way, to add new and more specialized
    instructions that can improve performance.'

- en: Arm CPUs are *reduced* instruction set computers (RISC). They improve performance
    by keeping the instruction set small and highly optimized, although some less
    common operations have to be implemented with subroutines involving several instructions.

    by adding many specialized instructions, some of which may only be rarely used

- en: The main advantage of RISC designs is that they result in simpler and smaller
    chips, which projects to lower manufacturing costs and power usage. It’s not surprising
    that the market segmented itself with Arm dominating battery-powered, general-purpose
    devices, and leaving the complex neural network and Galois field calculations
    to server-grade, highly-specialized x86s.

    vendor-neutral names of “x86-64” or just “x64.” A similar 64-bit extension of
    Arm is called “AArch64” or “ARM64.” In this book, we will just use plain “x86”
    and “Arm” implying the 64-bit versions. [↩︎](#fnref:1) [← ../Computer Architecture](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/architecture/)[Assembly
