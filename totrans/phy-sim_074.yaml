- en: Stress is a tensor field that quantifies the pressure or tension exerted on
    a material object. In the context of hyperelastic materials, the **first Piola-Kirchhoff
    stress tensor** P plays a crucial role. It is defined as the derivative of the
    strain energy density function Ψ, with respect to the deformation gradient F,
    establishing a **constitutive relationship** between stress and strain.

    dynamics**, it is essential to compute P and its derivative ∂F∂P​ efficiently.
    By leveraging the sparsity structure in diagonal space, these computations become
    more feasible. Here, differentiations are primarily required for Ψ with respect
    to the principal stretches σi​, which simplifies the calculation process.

    elasticity model**, which will be demonstrated through the [compressing square
    simulation](lec11.2-compress_square.html). This application will use the concepts
    discussed in this chapter to address complex real-world problems in solid mechanics.
