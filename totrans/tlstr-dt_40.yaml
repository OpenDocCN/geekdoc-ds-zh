    thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that
    could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then
    this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned,
    but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important
    to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables,
    of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features
    of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships
    between the variables. You are not doing EDA in this section--you are talking
    the reader through the variables that are of interest. If this becomes too detailed,
    then appendices could be used. Basically, for every variable in your dataset that
    is of interest to your paper there needs to be graphs and explanation and maybe
    tables. |

    and reproduction code should be in R. So you will need to translate the code into
    R for the replication. And the reproduction should be your own work, so that also
    should be in R. One common language is Stata, and Huntington-Klein ([2022](99-references.html#ref-lost2022))
    might be useful as a “Rosetta Stone” of sorts, for R, Python, and Stata, or just

    this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned,

    of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships

    this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned,

    to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables,
    of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features
    of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships
    between the variables. You are not doing EDA in this section--you are talking
    the reader through the variables that are of interest. If this becomes too detailed,
    then appendices could be used. Basically, for every variable in your dataset that
    is of interest to your paper there needs to be graphs and explanation and maybe

    effects as levels, categorizing gender). If applicable, define and justify sensible
    priors for Bayesian models. Clearly discuss underlying assumptions, potential
    limitations, and situations where the model may not be appropriate. Mention the
    software used to implement the model, and provide evidence of model validation
    and checking—such as out-of-sample testing, RMSE calculations, test/training splits,
    or sensitivity analyses—addressing model convergence and diagnostics (although

    this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned,
    but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey. It is important
    to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables,
    of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features
    of these data. Summary statistics should also be included, and well as any relationships
    between the variables. You are not doing EDA in this section--you are talking
    the reader through the variables that are of interest. If this becomes too detailed,
    then appendices could be used. Basically, for every variable in your dataset that
    is of interest to your paper there needs to be graphs and explanation and maybe
    tables. |

    overly simplistic nor unnecessarily complicated—for the situation. Variables should
    be well-defined and correspond with those in the data section. Explain how modeling
    decisions reflect aspects discussed in the data section, including why specific
    features are included (e.g., using age rather than age groups, treating province
    effects as levels, categorizing gender). If applicable, define and justify sensible
    priors for Bayesian models. Clearly discuss underlying assumptions, potential
    limitations, and situations where the model may not be appropriate. Mention the
    software used to implement the model, and provide evidence of model validation
    and checking—such as out-of-sample testing, RMSE calculations, test/training splits,
    or sensitivity analyses—addressing model convergence and diagnostics (although
    much of the detail make be in the appendix). Include any alternative models or
    variants considered, their strengths and weaknesses, and the rationale for the
    final model choice. |
