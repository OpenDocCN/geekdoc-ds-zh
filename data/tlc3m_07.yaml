- en: 'Centuries before supercomputers processed trillions of records each second,
    the story of statistics began with something far simpler: the human desire to
    know how many. Ancient rulers needed to count their soldiers and their fields;
    priests wanted to know when floods would come; merchants wished to weigh, measure,
    and exchange with fairness. To count was to make the world manageable. But somewhere
    between the grain storehouse and the royal archive, humanity discovered something
    extraordinary. In adding up its people, its harvests, and its fortunes, it was
    also adding up itself.'

- en: In ancient Egypt, scribes followed the rise of the Nile and the reach of the
    plough, translating the rhythm of the river into numbers carved on papyrus. Their
    tallies determined taxes, rations, and offerings to the gods. In Babylon, clay
    tablets held neat rows of wedge-shaped marks, each one a record of grain, livestock,
    or silver. Across the Mediterranean, Roman censors listed citizens, property,
    and debts, binding every person to the machinery of the state. The very word “statistics”
    would one day come from the Latin *status*, meaning the condition of the state.
    In every ancient civilization, counting was a matter of governance.

- en: This approach bridged statistics and structure. Rather than compute blindly,
    machines could reason with relationships, tracing chains of influence and disentangling
    hidden causes. Pearl’s later work in causal inference pushed further, showing
    how to distinguish correlation from causation - how to imagine interventions,
    not just observe them.

- en: The Bayesian turn was not merely technical; it was epistemological. It redefined
    what it means to know. Truth, in this light, is not a binary revelation but a
    moving estimate, converging through evidence. Every model is provisional, every
    conclusion a confession of confidence, not conviction.

  zh: 贝叶斯转向不仅仅是技术上的；它还是认识论上的。它重新定义了知道意味着什么。从这种观点来看，真理不是二元启示，而是一个不断变化的估计，通过证据逐渐收敛。每个模型都是临时的，每个结论都是对自信的承认，而不是确信。
- en: This humility gave science a new grace. Instead of clinging to absolutes, thinkers
    could express doubt with rigor. Weather forecasts report 70% chance of rain, doctors
    estimate risks in percentages, economists speak in confidence intervals - a language
    honest about ignorance, yet firm in proportion.

- en: In Bayesian reasoning, uncertainty is not the enemy of knowledge but its engine.
    Without doubt, no update; without surprise, no learning. Every new fact is valuable
    only because belief could have been otherwise.

    then tolerance - for dissent, for error, for ambiguity - becomes a rational virtue.

    science read its own uncertainty. In cosmology, where experiments are few and
    phenomena distant, inference guides discovery. Astronomers estimate the curvature
