    things were assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. People must have
    had an intuitive sense of some statistical facts (e.g., that women are usually
    shorter than men), but they had no mathematical tools that would allow them to
    proceed from anecdotal evidence to statistical conclusions. This started to change
    in the middle of the seventeenth century, most notably with the publication of
    John Graunt's *Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Bills of Mortality*.
    This pioneering work used statistical analysis to estimate the population of London
    from death rolls and attempted to provide a model that could be used to predict
    the spread of plague.

    the same variance for `x` (`10.0`), the same variance for `y` (`3.75`), and the
    same correlation between `x` and `y` (`0.816`). And if we use linear regression
    to fit a line to each, we get the same result for each, `y = 0.5x + 3`.

    One possibility is to conduct a **prospective study**. In a prospective study,
    one starts with a set of hypotheses, recruits subjects before they have developed
    the outcome of interest (anorexia in this case), and then follows the subjects
    for a period of time. If the group had conducted a prospective study with a specific
    hypothesis and gotten similar results, we might be convinced.

    is to split the data into a training set and a held out test set. For example,
    they could have chosen `446/2` women at random from their data (the training set)
    and tallied the number of births for each month. They could have then compared
    that to the number of births each month for the remaining women (the holdout set).
