- en: 'To fully appreciate the PBD approach, it is essential to first understand the
    classical formulation of Lagrangian dynamics it gets inspired. The state of a
    dynamic system composed of N particles is described by their individual mass mi​,
    position pi​∈R3, and velocity vi​∈R3. The evolution of this system is governed
    by a pair of first-order ordinary differential equations derived from Newton''s
    second law: v˙i​=mi​1​fi​(32.1.1) p˙​i​=vi​(32.1.2) where fi​ is the sum of all
    forces on particle i.'

- en: Finally, interactions and physical limits are modeled using **holonomic constraints**,
    which depend only on positions and orientations, but not velocities! Constraints
    are kinematic restrictions in the form of equations and inequalities that constrain
    the relative motion of bodies. An **equality (bilateral)** constraint takes the
    form Cj​(p,q)=0, while an **inequality (unilateral)** constraint is Cj​(p,q)≥0.
    In classical dynamics, these are satisfied by computing constraint forces and
    adding them to fi​ in Equation [(32.1.1)](#eq:lagrangian:particle_motion). It
    is this specific mechanism for handling constraints that PBD fundamentally changes.
